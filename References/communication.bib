	abstract = {With a focus on the perceptions of smallholder / family farmers from the North-eastern Semiarid region of Brazil - one of the most climate change-vulnerable populations of the country-, this article describes the collaborative creation and dissemination process of a didactic booklet (cartilha educativa, in Portuguese) aimed at sharing visions of climate change-related risks and adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers from the region. The research team, member of the subnet on Climate Change and Regional Development (MCDR/Rede CLIMA), applied 1.140 semi-structured questionnaires in four selected areas: Serido Potiguar-RN, Gilbues-PI, JuazeiroBA and Chapada do Araripe-CE. The survey focused on, among others, family farmers' perceptions on climatic risks and adaptation options, as well as their cultural values and expectations regarding the future of their rural livelihoods. Based on those perceptions and expectations, a didactic booklet was chosen as the best instrument to co-create knowledge about climatic change impact and adaptation strategies in the region. By prioritizing dialogue and the exchange of viewpoints - or, in Habermas' words, “the negotiation of common definitions of situations”-, the team assumed that potential users are more likely to trust knowledge, and may therefore be willing to act on it, when from their perspective it meets three criteria: relevance, credibility, and legitimacy. In general terms, the experience of using this didactic booklet confirmed that barriers to successful climate change adaptation (such as mutual incomprehension between scientists and end-users) could be overcome by creating collaborative enterprises. The co-creation of the didactic booklet, which included switching roles between knowledge producers and end-users, facilitated horizontal work towards the identification of climaterelated risks and possible adaptation measures.},

	abstract = {Working with farmers' groups, associations and cooperatives constitutes a fundamental element of extension work with family farmers. Despite the fact that extension practitioners face many problems in this area of their work, there is currently a lack of academic literature that systematically addresses the topic and offers concrete guidelines for practice. Thus, this paper will aim to clarify the benefits of farmers' groups, associations and networks within the context of family farming, systematise problems faced by rural extensionists when working with farmers' groups and associations, provide conceptual tools for understanding group and associative processes, and construct a set of guidelines and recommendations for facing said problems. In order to achieve these aims, the authors conducted an extensive literature review and drew upon their personal experience on the topic. Results suggest that some of the benefits of associative work are: better access to inputs, produce and credit markets, the facilitation of learning processes, the empowerment of family farmers as social actors, and a reduction of rural extension costs. Additionally, with respects to the problems faced by extensionists, the following can be highlighted: individualist attitudes and conflicts between farmers, scarce participation and commitment, problems with leaderships and with organisations' administrative management, and the lack of extensionists' training to address these processes, among others. With regards to the factors that increase trust and cooperation are: interpersonal communication and mutual knowledge, sharing problems, values and objectives, and the existence of shared rules for the functioning of the group that include sanctions for transgressors. In this context, the extensionists' role will be that of facilitating processes of construction of group relationships, creating rules for the groups' functioning and developing the group's capacities for self-management.

The results show that the GCTs adoption behaviors of adjacent family farmers are spatially correlated and strongest when they are within 2.0 km of each other. Farm leaders' educational level, degree of risk preference, financial status, number of laborers, understanding of GCTs and of the dangers of chemical pesticides, knowledge of other GCT adopters, frequency of communication with neighbors, participation in technical training and the strength of media publicity have significantly positive effects on the GCT adoption behaviors of family farms, which are mainly influenced by the direct effects of characteristic variables. However, the spatial spillover effects of neighboring family farmers' participation in technical training, number of laborers, and financial status cannot be ignored. This result provides not only theoretical support for the demonstration and extension of the effectiveness of GCTs but also a reference for the selection of family farms as model households.},

We developed a bibliographical and documentary research, using the following research sources: laws, ordinances, decrees and references on the field of education in Brazil. We also use the agricultural census data 2006, stressing the importance of family farming in the Brazilian table. In this context, we find that the process of teaching and learning must dialogue with the concrete reality of the subjects, individual and collective, linked to the struggle for land. We conclude that the collective production of knowledge in partnership with students / as, educators / as, communities and social movements struggling for land, can dialogue with stories, memories, identities, desires, values and recognition, strengthening the debate around education of the field for its close relationship with social movements, field schools and public universities.},

This article reports on the communication process between participants and non-participants in one such approach, related to the technical and management skills learned by participants and the changes these participants subsequently made, and the outcomes in terms of non-participants' learning. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this study, we analysed the following: (1) participants' learning and changes in social practices; (2) communication between participants and non-participants regarding technical and management skills and changes in social practices; (3) non-participants' learning and changes in social practices. The case study was a management advice to family farm project in three villages in Benin. Findings: Most participants learned management skills, which led them to reassess their objectives and to reduce traditional social practices they now considered unproductive. Even in the case of frequent communication, non-participants found it difficult to learn management skills, which hindered their experiential learning. Non-participants consequently had difficulty understanding why participants changed their social practices such as reduction of their traditional gift giving, leading to limited well-argued discussion about these changes in practices between participants and non-participants. Practical Implications: This study shows that, due to the limited learning process of non-participants communicating with participants, there is a need to design and test approaches to achieve capacity-building while including more participants at a similar cost, and to stimulate explicit discussion at village level about the changes in values and social practices that these approaches may trigger. Originality/Value: The article analyses both participants and non-participants' experiential learning, and looks at the two sides of the interaction between the communication processes and non-participants' learning.},

	abstract = {Technique adoption behavior by family farms comprises three stages with progressive relation, including information collection, adoption willingness, and adoption intensity. To explore the influence factors of the adoption of green control techniques (GCTs) by family farms, this study focused on sample selection problems, namely, understanding (or not) and willingness (or not), using bivariate probit and regression linear models based on a field survey data from 676 family farms in Huang-huai-hai Plain. Estimation results showed that: 1) the frequency of neighbor communication, the strengths of the extension of agricultural technique sector and media publicity, education, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant positive influences on information collection individually; however, the gender of farmers had a significant negative influence. 2) The perceived ease of use and usefulness about the technique, the number of laborers, the strength of the extension of agricultural technique sector, education, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant positive influences on adoption willingness. 3) Finally, the perceived ease of use and usefulness about the technique, fund status, the strengths of media publicity and the extension of agricultural technique sector, and education of farmers had significant positive influences on adoption intensity; whereas the frequency of neighbor communion, gender, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant negative influences on adoption intensity. Thus, to develop the GCTs successfully, the Chinese government should improve the effects of technique training, ameliorate financing environment, focus on publicity and guidance, establish and improve the system of education and training for family farmers, and strengthen the team concerning the extended construction of grassroots technique.

The study was conducted at a Family Farmer Fair, located in Braganca-PA, due to the entire documentary organization, photographic archive and historical archive of nine years based on Solidarity Economy experiences. Procedurally, participant observation and semi-structured interviews with popular educators and marketers were used. From the content analysis emerged, among the results, that the experience of solidarity economy lived at the Family Farmer's Fair of Braganca-PA is presented as pedagogical praxis, which is carried out through training of the Diocesan Caritas Braganca and EMATER, between the subjects themselves and exchanges between communities. Attitudes of nature preservation and sustainable development by the marketers are directly linked to the traditional practices and popular knowledge that they carry throughout their lives.},

Ordering effects are eliminated by warming up subjects in advance and using information disclosure. This paper uses the inferred attribute non-attendance method to process attributes ignored by the grain family farms and analyzes grain family farms' preferences for different support policies with a mixed logit model and then uses a latent class model to analyze how the characteristics of grain family farms relate to different preference types. We find that grain family farms have a strong preference for agricultural subsidies, credit support, and technical support (the mean coefficient is greater than 0.8). Moreover, the preferences of grain family farms over the policy communication channel (the mean coefficient is greater than 0.5) cannot be ignored. Faced with the same policy attribute combination, grain family farms with high education levels, reasonable scales of operation, and good understanding of support policies are more likely to improve their profit margins. There are four preference types of grain family farms: finance preference (43.2\%), knowledge and technology preference (28.5\%), land transfer preference (15.4\%), and policy information preference (12.9\%).},

The organization of advisory services at the territorial scale is the fruit of policy choices and social relationships between actors which have evolved through time. The forms such intervention can take in connection with farmers, constantly oscillating between logics of managing them and logics of accompanying them, are often born by different and sometimes contradictory actors. The increasing numbers of actors interacting within the farming and rural sphere along with the rapidly increasing risks and uncertainties weighing on agricultural production lead to questions on the role advisory services should play and how it should position itself within an innovation system.},

	abstract = {Decision support systems (DSS), like other information systems (IS) before them, were designed to serve functions deemed by `management scientists' to be potentially useful to managers. But the unwelcome fact is that the use of agricultural DSSs by managers of farms has been low. This paper probes possible reasons for this through interpretation of agricultural DSS case histories and several strands of relevant social theory. From nine cases of DSS development effort and 14 products interpreted comparatively, a number of generalisations are made that serve as reference points in the following search for explanation in theory. First, the nature of management practice of family farms is explored and differences between the internal structure governing personal action and the scientific approach to practice are contrasted. Next, the interaction between the nature of the particular action/practice and the nature of the DSS is explored. A DSS designed to provide integrated, optimal recommendations for management typifies the DSS as a proxy for a manager's decision process. Examples of elaborate expert systems that simply were not used dramatically illustrate the resistance of family farmers to have their decision processes by-passed. On the other hand, the DSS designed to serve as a tool in a modified decision process is shown to have experienced higher use, by deriving and exploiting `deep,' abstract information about the system, by introducing a powerful `logic,' or a combination of both. A number of the referenced case stories demonstrate the resurgence of the decision support mode whereby the simulator is in the hands of an expert intermediary as an alternative to easy-to-use software in the hands of a farmer. This is the mode of operational research/management science, which preceded the DSS. In comparison with hierarchical organizations, available options for overcoming the persistent `problem of implementation' of the DSS in family farms are inherently weak. This focuses attention on the importance of the relationship between the DSS developer and the potential user. Drawing on a classic typology of possible configurations of `understanding' between the scientist and the manager, four approaches to intervention are discussed. Three entail a degree of engagement that qualifies them as `participative.' But one of these constitutes a departure from the DSS and broader IS traditions that places it in another paradigm. In this `mutual understanding' relationship, intervention intent shifts from educating and persuading to recognition of and respect for other ways of viewing the world. This opens up the opportunities for co-creating information systems that utilise the comparative advantages of both practical and scientific knowledge. Intervention emphasis shifts from prescribing action to,facilitating learning in actions. Although the DSS has fallen far short of expectations in its influence on farm management, the experience has been instructive in multiple ways to both farmers and professionals in agriculture. In many cases, farmers learned from the DSS and could then jettison it without loss. From disappointments scientists have sometimes learned what was needed to achieve a better outcome. From collated DSS experiences, important lessons for the future can be drawn. The paper concludes by conjecturing that the future of the DSS and related ISs, while more limited than once imagined, holds promise in four directions: a `small' tool for aiding farmers' tactical decisions; a versatile simulator as a consultant's tool; a versatile simulator as the core of a facilitated `learning laboratory,' and a formal framework that supports regulatory objectives in constraining and documenting farming practice.

Based on a qualitative research process, we compare two individual livelihood strategies from rural Hungary, the case of a family farmer and a potter. We argue that scientific, local and managerial knowledge forms cannot be identified in pure forms in Hungarian rural initiatives. In the absence of a strong networking capacity, rural entrepreneurs replace knowledge-sharing and community-learning processes with individual knowledge-gathering strategies. As a consequence, person-bound, multifaceted knowledge sets are used in rural initiatives and are produced according to context; however, the absence of knowledge dynamics hinders actors in developing sustainable solutions. Thus, rural development policy should encourage interaction among different rural actors instead of aiming at providing better education for managerial knowledge.},

	abstract = {Science should be capable of covering issues as diverse as farming systems, technology, innovation, climate change adaptation, poverty alleviation, extension, policy and practice, as they all relate to sustainable agriculture and development. Some years ago, the call for a new farming systems approach was raised to accommodate the principles of interdisciplinary, systems thinking and participatory research. Society calls for systems performance that provides stability and sustainability (SDGs!), multi-scale and territorial approaches and looks for solutions for critical issues such as employment, migration and inclusion/exclusion at the global level (World Society). We propose here a way in dealing with this complexity by addressing the mentioned problem from the communication and symbolic perspective, i.e. to consider the “object” within agricultural science but mainly observe the dedicated systems of communication. By using the concept of social systems, we can accommodate under it systems as diverse as farms, extension organizations, innovation patterns, (agricultural) sciences, policy and politics, farmer and indigenous knowledge, markets and value chains, but always in the form of communication. As such, we remain within a discipline with the potential to evolve towards a promising sub-discipline of agricultural sciences (or of sociology?). The relatively new farming approach of certified organic in combination with agroecology is relevant for family farms and small-scale entities. It depends much more on societal support for extension, technology development and policy coherence than commercial farms. Organic agriculture, with its standards, technological requirements and consumer preferences is nested in socio-economic and political networks, which makes it challenging for researchers to integrate the various components. This challenge applies particularly to countries with poorly developed institutions, weak organizations and within the context of poverty and rural exodus. We therefore use a unified approach under a single scientific system. This system observes, analyses and reports on communication aspects of involved (observed!) social systems (including networks and interactions) within the society of any given nation, including the realities of globalized markets. We are developing a case study based in Mali, in which we apply this method. The case is describing a planning process involving cotton farmers from the Sikasso region, the cotton industry, public and private extension systems, farmer organizations, local governments, the NARS (IER), FiBL, donors and the national institutions involved in climate change adaptation and food security. Various technological options of production (conventional, organic) and farming systems are available. The reflexive use of science dealing with human behavior may facilitate the pragmatic participation of researchers from various disciplines in addressing the uncertainties and opportunities that lie ahead of us and achieve the required impacts together with the practitioners.},

The results showed that 65.68\% of the differences were caused by individual-level factors, and 34.32\% were caused by provincial-level factors. The factors at the individual level, including the improvement of production equipment (WE), education of farmers (EOF), regularization of management rules (RMR), and difficulty level of getting loans (DLL), had positive effects on growth of family farm, whereas the frequency of staff participating in training (FST) had a negative effect. At provincial level, improvement of the support policy system (IDSPS) could strengthen the positive correlation between RMR and growth of family farm. Moreover, the factor IDSPS combined with ability of agricultural cooperatives providing social services (AACPS) and spacious degree of technology access channel (SDTAC) could strengthen the positive correlation between EOF and growth of family farm, and reduced the negative correlation between FST and dependent variable. The results suggested that government should support farms to improve production equipment and financing pattern, transfer the method of re-education of grain family farmers, promote the standardization of grain family farms, establish a sound policy support system, improve the social service ability of agricultural cooperatives, and broaden the channels of technology acquisition.},

To promote the interest of farmers in adopting pest control services for cleaner production, the preference of farmers for pest control firms must be determined. Based on a survey of 433 grain family farms in the Huang-huai-hai Plain and using the choice experiment method, this study eliminates the ordering effect through prior “warm-up” and “disclosure” and uses inferred attribute non-attendance to process information on the attributes of for-profit pest control firms that were neglected by grain family farms. The hierarchical Bayes generalized mixed logit model was used to examine the preference for for-profit pest control firms by grain family farms. The results indicate that grain family farms prefer to adopt pest control services and select for-profit pest control firms that satisfy their requirements (the coefficient of alternative specific constant, 0.627, is significant and negative). Grain family farms are heterogeneous in their preferences of for-profit pest control firms, and they particularly prefer those provide yield commitment, with high service efficiency, and allow payment delayed (the values of the mean coefficients are all greater than 1.0). Under the same combination of for-profit pest control firms attributes, the increase in profit per mu for grain family farms with highly educated farmers, who mainly plant rice and highly acknowledge the value of pest control services and the danger of chemical pesticides can possibly increase further (all interaction terms of alternative specific constant, i.e., -0.394, 0.381, -0.453, -0.779, -0.431 and -0.428, are significant).

	abstract = {Grazing plays a key role in reducing the external inputs required for ruminant production and in alleviating feed-food competition. Beyond the production of meat and milk, grassland-based systems provide a wide range of ecosystem services. Agroecology and organic farming aim to reconcile natural resource management and food production, in the long term, based on the management of ecological processes. In this perspective paper, we report what we have learned from case studies with beef cattle, sheep, and dairy cattle across Uruguay and western Europe, in which we have been involved. Multicriteria methods, such as Pareto frontiers and positive deviances, were used to analyze trade-offs and identify win-wins from farm surveys. Long-term farm networks coupled with bioeconomic optimization models revealed fluctuations in farm income and allowed estimating system resilience. Extensive farmlet experiments made it possible to integrate knowledge on animal physiology and grassland ecology in the system redesign process and to test for innovative and risky management options that could lead to unacceptable learning costs in commercial farms. Finally, learning from farmers' local knowledge in teams with researchers and technical advisers can provide positive changes in grazing systems. In Uruguayan family farms, for example, the scientific knowledge gained from farmlet experiments led to advice on management options based on farm-specific diagnosis. Farmers adapted the proposals, with researchers supporting the processes by providing quantitative information on consequences and spaces for reflection. In a French cheese production area, the focus was on farmers' own experience. Games facilitated interactions as participants could challenge each other's reasoning and conclusions in a safe environment. These two case studies illustrate the diversity of co-innovation approaches, but in both cases knowledge sharing between researchers, farmers, and other stakeholders appeared more efficient to help farmers understand and adapt their own system properties than researching “best practice” solutions for large-scale transfer.},

Most of these approaches tend to frame seasonal climate forecasts as a discrete product with direct and linear effects. In contrast, the authors propose that agricultural management is a performative process, constituted by a combination of planning, experimentation, and improvisation and drawing on a mix of technical expertise, situated knowledge, cumulative experience, and intuitive skill as farmers navigate a myriad of risks in the pursuit of livelihood goals and economic opportunities. This study draws on ethnographic interviews conducted with 38 family farmers in southern Georgia, examining their livelihood goals and social values, strategies for managing risk, and interactions with weather and climate information, specifically their responses to seasonal climate forecasts. Findings highlight the social nature of information processing and risk management, indicating that both material conditions and value-based attitudes bear upon the ways farmers may integrate climate predictions into their agricultural management practices. These insights translate into specific recommendations that will enhance the salience, credibility, and legitimacy of seasonal climate forecasts among farmers and will promote the incorporation of such information into a skillful performance in the face of climate uncertainty.},

To that aim, a transformative methodology is applied involving representatives of farmers' associations, supporting organisations and researchers from various disciplinary fields. We analyse the network of initiatives against the conceptual background of sociotechnical niches and identify a stable niche where generic lessons are being systematically identified and used to establish replication projects. However, this niche is still limited in its breadth, which results in a low capacity for expansion and a strong dependency on international donors for reproducing experiences. Specific recommendations are outlined for broadening the type of actors involved in the interpretation and dissemination of lessons from the niche. Moreover, we outline suggestions for further research and conceptualisation in two directions: for exploring effective ways of broadening the niche and translating niche lessons to state policies and for deepening the understanding of interactions between the niche and other levels.},

	abstract = {Social farming helps mountain farms to deal with current socioeconomic challenges that threaten the cultural identity and traditions of mountain areas. It is an innovative bottom-up initiative that addresses societal needs and complements institutionalized social services. In the north Italian province of South Tyrol, social farming is mainly implemented by women farmers offering educational services on their farms. This paper examines how these activities influence the transmission and transformation of (agri)-cultural values of mountain farming in South Tyrol. Data were extracted from a 2017 online survey among farmers who offered educational services in this province. The results demonstrate that farms offering these services are distributed throughout the whole region. Through the variety of topics included in their lessons, farmers have a key role in transmitting (agri)-cultural values and traditions to non farmers. Although farm-based educational services in general may increase a farm's income, the results show that they contribute little to the economic viability of the farm. Nevertheless, these services provide an interesting field of action, where all family members can share ideas and interact with children, teachers, and parents. In parallel to cultural transmission, farm-based educational services can therefore transform traditional (agri)-cultural values in family farms, shifting from traditionally patriarchal values. Women farmers, in particular, gain an opportunity to acquire new skills and a personal income, independent of agricultural production. Therefore, the provision of these services contributes to the social sustainability of family farms.},

Using survey panel data from a Chinese village, we adopt a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) derived from spatial econometrics to disentangle the social interaction effect from spillover effects and to control for technological heterogeneities. Our analysis reveals a negative social interaction effect indicating that an increase in the yield of neighbouring plots leads to a decrease in the yield of the plot itself. We also find input spillovers. Labour, capital costs, water and organic pesticides have positive spillovers while external nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate) have negative spillover effects. Our study thus calls for a better understanding of social interactions and spillover effects among farmers in the promotion of sustainable family farming.},

	abstract = {Multifunctionality serves as an analytical framework to recognize many services that farms provide to their surrounding communities and society. This study explores an often overlooked dimension of multifunctionality by examining different recreational services provided by landowners in Missouri and analyzing the relationship between recreational multifunctionality and the practice of agroforestry. The latter provides multiple economic, environmental and beautification benefits that involve trees in the landscape. Results show that family farms provide several recreational services for their household members and others, and the existence of synergies between the recreational function of the farmland and agroforestry practices, consistent with the transition to strong multifunctionality. The recreational use of the land is positively associated to the cognitive (i.e., perceived knowledge) and affective (i.e., willingness to adopt) attitudes towards agroforestry. Results also show that the higher the perception of intrinsic (i.e., planting trees for wind protection and carbon sequestration) and economic (i.e., perceived economic benefits and flood protection) values of agroforestry, the more recreational use of the land. This study exemplifies the interactions between two little examined farmland functions providing insights for a comprehensive value assessment of family farms. Other academic and practical implications of the study are also detailed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The systems are managed in the contexts of agroecological farming and include “Africanized honeybees” and native “stingless bees,” integrated among trees and crops. We show that the dynamics of investigation that follows the guidelines presented by family farmers and traditional people contribute to their empowerment and to changing their own reality, favoring endogenous development and the dialogue of knowledge. The participatory experiences by ISEC and EMBRAPA Temperate Agriculture through the organization and mobilization of farmers and traditional people generated organizational structures that build local food systems.

This paper reports on the development of a participatory methodology to systematize long-term experimentation with agroforestry systems carried out in a hotspot of biodiversity by non-governmental organizations and local farmers. A methodological guide for systematization and techniques used for Participatory Rural Appraisal formed the basis of our work. We propose an analytical framework that recognizes systems of reflexive and learning interactions, in order to make the learned lessons explicit. At the process level, the main lessons and recommendations are as follows. It is important to establish partnerships to conduct innovative and complex experimentation with agroforest. Participatory systematization allows us to improve the methodological aspects of design, implementation and management of on-farm participatory experimentation. It also serves to synthesize the main findings and to extract lessons from agroforestry systems experiments. It fosters the technical improvement of agroforestry systems. It creates possibilities for reflection on agroforestry systems by farmers, extensionists and researchers, as well as their learning with respect to management of such systems. The findings are placed in the context of current theory on participatory experimentation in agriculture. Extractive and interactive approaches help to produce rich insights of mutual interest through collaboration by identifying local, regional and global convergences, complementarities, and conflicts of interest; which affect the advance of new eco-friendly technologies, to both improve the livelihoods and to reverse biodiversity loss and environmental degradation.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the capacity of individuals or social groups to produce responses to cope with and overcome barriers, when exposed to situations that may compromise their ability to guarantee family subsistence, are quite heterogeneous, even in similar environments. Social factors may constrain it, or even facilitate it, in a much more decisive way than the exposure and behavior of the natural factors involved in the processes of adaptation to contemporary environmental changes. Therefore, the ability of individuals to react or adapt to new situations seeking to reduce their vulnerability, especially those residing in rural areas, is the objective result of the action linked to daily experience, in the interaction that it can produce between the natural and social system and presupposes the existence of individual and / or collective learning processes. To demonstrate this characteristic, we identified the main subsistence strategies mobilized by family farmers in the Alto Guapore region, in the southwestern state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The study, carried out with an empirical universe of fifty-one respondents in five municipalities, revealed that the functioning of the institutional framework can decisively induce and / or condition the individuals' capacity to mobilize the arrangements and forms of production used to guarantee family reproduction. Therefore, the correct identification of its functioning and its diversity play an important role in the determination of vulnerability.},

	abstract = {The use of agent-based modelling approaches in ex-post and ex-ante evaluations of agricultural policies has been progressively increasing over the last few years. There are now a sufficient number of models that it is worth taking stock of the way these models have been developed. Here, we review 20 agricultural agent-based models (ABM) addressing heterogeneous decision-making processes in the context of European agriculture. The goals of this review were to i) develop a framework describing aspects of farmers' decision-making that are relevant from a farm-systems perspective, ii) reveal the current state-of-the-art in representing farmers' decision-making in the European agricultural sector, and iii) provide a critical reflection of underdeveloped research areas and on future opportunities in modelling decision-making. To compare different approaches in modelling farmers' behaviour, we focused on the European agricultural sector, which presents a specific character with its family farms, its single market and the common agricultural policy (CAP). We identified several key properties of farmers' decision-making: the multi-output nature of production; the importance of non-agricultural activities; heterogeneous household and family characteristics; and the need for concurrent short- and long-term decision-making. These properties were then used to define levels and types of decision-making mechanisms to structure a literature review. We find most models are sophisticated in the representation of farm exit and entry decisions, as well as the representation of long-term decisions and the consideration of farming styles or types using farm typologies. Considerably fewer attempts to model farmers' emotions, values, learning, risk and uncertainty or social interactions occur in the different case studies. We conclude that there is considerable scope to improve diversity in representation of decision-making and the integration of social interactions in agricultural agent-based modelling approaches by combining existing modelling approaches and promoting model inter-comparisons. Thus, this review provides a valuable entry point for agent-based modellers, agricultural systems modellers and data driven social scientists for the re-use and sharing of model components, code and data. An intensified dialogue could fertilize more coordinated and purposeful combinations and comparisons of ABM and other modelling approaches as well as better reconciliation of empirical data and theoretical foundations, which ultimately are key to developing improved models of agricultural systems.},

	abstract = {`Sustainable intensification' of agricultural production, or `producing more with less', has been widely adopted as a policy approach by national governments and international agencies, including the European Union (EU) through its Common Agricultural Policy. Sustainable intensification will be facilitated through on-farm innovation in a process that is fostered by knowledge sharing between actors with complementary forms of knowledge. These actors, their organisations, the knowledge flows between them and the so-called `enabling environment' constitute an `agricultural innovation system' (AIS). This paper begins by reviewing recent international theoretical development of the AIS concept and of equivalent concepts in the EU. Although the international and EU development paths are similar, there are clear differences between them. It is argued that these different perspectives can be integrated into a single `multi-level' model, with family farming at its centre. The paper then explores current agricultural innovation policy discourse in the EU. Based on the European Innovation Partnership `Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI), this may result in the adoption of a new and contestable use of the term `Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System' or `AKIS' that is reminiscent of the EU's treatment of the term `Rural Development'. The paper argues, however, that this development may in fact add clarity to the understanding of the agricultural innovation systems concept. Greater dialogue between researchers, policy makers and others in the EU and beyond offers the welcome prospect of greater coherence between future EU and international approaches to fostering agricultural innovation.},

	abstract = {Historically, innovation in industrialised agricultural landscapes has been slow. Likewise, future climate change adaptation (CCA) will also be slow if complex interactions highlighted in the innovation and adoption literature are ignored. The aim of this review is to collate and conceptualise this multidisciplinary literature into a nested multi-scale spatial hierarchy to understand the complexity of the CCA decision making process, highlighting the influential factors across the nested scales. Seven nested hierarchical scales were identified under an overarching level of governance. The outer boundary is the Hazardscape a spatially defined climatic region where potential impacts of climate change (CC) and suitable CCA strategies are defined. Differing socio-economic and demographic profiles (Community Typologies) under this scale mean that these strategies need to be tailored to enhance community adoption and bolster their resilience to CC. The strength and type of social interaction within and between Community will also influence CCA. Central to the hierarchy is the variation in Individuals' beliefs and risk perceptions. Greater CC risk perception within the Household can enhance or constrain CCA at the Farm scale. In turn, the Farm scale attributes can influence CCA. Differing Farm and Farmer characteristics provide a further layer of complexity when considering CCA capability. Greater knowledge and evaluation of the circumstances and factors involved in CCA decision making highlighted by the use of the hierarchy will create an evidence base which will allow a more targeted approach to CCA. Adoption can be increased through a targeted range of CCA strategies and tailored plans of communication and dissemination of CC and CCA information across the nested scales. This approach will build much needed momentum for CCA in a rural setting. While the interaction between scales is discussed, future research is required to understand the cross-scale interactions, feedback loops and temporal dynamics within the hierarchy.

In many editions of the Fair, health inspectors found recurring inadequacies in the marketing of these products. Objective: In order to innovate the conduct of Sanitary Surveillance in food in reducing risks, to create an instrument called “prior communication” with exhibitors, to be applied and evaluated as a health education resource. Method: The “prior communication” was written reaffirming the co-responsibility between the Surveillance and exhibitors for consumers' health, as well as the inadequacies observed in previous editions. In the 2016 and 2017 editions, three months before the event, it was sent to the exhibiting agribusiness. To measure the influence of the instrument in reducing inadequacies, part of Annex II of RDC / Anvisa 43/2015 was used. Results: By comparing the inadequacies of the years 2014/15 with those of 2016/17, we find the following examples: the raw materials transported, stored and preserved, including temperature, from 62.50\% of the stands decreased to 5.71\% in 2016 and 14.21\% in 2017; the temperature of the food kept in the exhibition and distribution equipment of 75.00\% of the stands decreased to 60.00\% in 2016 and 3.57\% in 2017; the labeling item of 62.50\% of the stands increased to 0\% in 2016 and 2017.

Professional plant breeders have had much difficulty developing modern varieties that outperform farmers' traditional varieties in these environments, in part because of an incomplete understanding of why farmers choose the varieties they grow. Improved understanding of farmers' varietal choices can contribute to collaboration between farmers and formal plant breeders. Based on a 15-month field study in Dissan, Mali, we examine farmer's choices among their traditional sorghum varieties in terms of one or more than one variety, and short-cycle or long-cycle varieties, and the interaction between these two choices. Results support our general hypothesis that farmers choose varieties to optimize outputs in the face of variation in the growing environment and in human managed inputs such as labor and tools.},

Our study begins to address this important gap by investigating OSCM decisions in the farm echelon-a challenging but critical echelon overwhelmingly composed of small and midsize family farms. Using the hermeneutic method, we delve into the minds of 18 farmers to explore how SME and family business distinctions influence their production and storage decisions. We further examine how these distinctions interact with elements of the supply chain and the institutional environment in which farmers are embedded. Our contextualized understanding offers important implications for supply chain theory, practice, and public policy.

To do this, we have first computed an innovation index for a sample farms, whereupon we have carried out a statistical analysis using linear regression method to find out about the most significant determinants of innovation. The main result is that direct interactions between farmers and local public agricultural research as well as user/producer interactions along the value chain are of the most contribution to innovation. Nevertheless, it turns out that farmers seem not take advantage of the operational knowledge that spills over from most of other knowledge and information institutions and organisations.},

The subject is developed from bibliographical and documental research (Brazilian legislations), besides testimonies from Brazilian researchers who have worked together with family farmers, smallholders, settlers, and recyclable material collectors that are organised in cooperatives and associations. Our analyses are structured in dialogue with the hypothesis of dysfunctionality of the university. A review of higher education and science and technology policies is carried out and considered in regard to inclusion and the relationship with the popular classes. Our focus is on the first decade of the twenty-first century, a brief period of neo-developmentalism that ended with the deepening of the current counter-reforms. Initially, it is analyzed the higher education. Then, it is discussed the trends in Science and Technology policy. This is followed by analyzes of the relationship between university and popular classes, an alternative that is carried out contradictorily.

	abstract = {Improving animal welfare is an important part of the development of the agricultural industry, particularly at a time when intensification and the encroachment of factory-style production systems is making the maintenance of human-animal relations increasingly difficult. Animal science deals with the issue of improving stockmanship by focusing on the relationships between attitudes and behaviour, under the premise that improved attitudes will lead to improved behaviour. From an analysis of 42 interviews with owners, sharemilkers and workers on dairy farms in New Zealand we present a different view, seeing behaviour instead as part of a self-reinforcing culture in which animals, humans and the physical structure all contribute to the development of farm specific ways of doing and being. We further suggest that changing one stockperson's attitude alone is insufficient to ensure a change in the culture as other actors - including animals and non-human actors - reinforce any existing culture that has developed, making both attitudinal and behavioural change difficult. We conclude by discussing the key importance of designing farm systems and structures that promote positive interactions between animals and humans and suggest that this, rather than simply promoting knowledge and attitudinal change, is likely to be the most effective way of maintaining stockmanship in the face of an industrialising agriculture.

Through such adaptation, farmers would gain better access to information and new markets and a better position in negotiations. Overall, they would become better managers of their businesses. The Internet, coupled with other information and communication technologies (ICT), represents a tool for linking up different interest groups within the vertical agricultural chain. The role and significance of ICT and information literacy within agricultural activities is presented through a review of European development initiatives and theoretical insights regarding this topic. To reveal obstacles (objective and subjective), the current level of skills and the readiness to adopt new knowledge and technologies, a survey was conducted on a representative sample of inhabitants from rural areas, i. e. farmers, since they are a determining factor of such changes. The present paper is part of the research exploring a wider context of ICT implementation aimed at enhancing farmers' competencies, and consequently, enhancing overall agricultural performance. The analysis seeks to confirm the basic hypothesis that there are objective and subjective obstacles, but also the interest and willingness to increase the level of knowledge in the observed social unit.},

We present lessons learned from applying the assessment approach in two contrasting situations: large, high-input, commercial agriculture in northwestern Mexico and small, low-input family farms in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. Applying the approach reveals five attributes required for success and the means to achieve those conditions. (1) Having a capable local champion for the project is critical.

Moreover, a chakra is an outstanding example of agroforestry production, in which ecological, social and economic elements co-evolve from a set of close and strong connections. In this context, the conservation and transformation of their biological subsystems can be understood as the result of complex interactions between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors. In turn, such interactions are essential to provide food and monetary income to the indigenous community. Relevant agency capabilities exist that could cause an agroforestry system to take a different path of co-evolution, that is, towards greater or lesser sustainability associated with different levels of complexity. In conclusion, chakras have key ecological features that can mitigate the impact of human population growth in Amazonia. Additionally, chakras have their own processes of social self-regulation which enhance the possibilities of adaptation of Kichwa communities to changing environmental conditions, being essential elements in local food sovereignty, equitable gender relations and the respect of ancestral wisdom.},

	abstract = {Alternative food networks (AFNs) are commonly defined by attributes such as the spatial proximity between farmers and consumers, the existence of retail venues such as farmers markets, community supported agriculture (CSA) and a commitment to sustainable food production and consumption. Focusing upon processes rather than attributes, this paper identifies two place-based processes that both promote and constrain the emergence and development of AFNs. Urbanization and rural restructuring are critical to the development of AFNs. AFNs are not a “thing” to be described, but rather emerge from political, cultural and historical processes. The interactions of urbanization and rural restructuring produce AFNs that are differentiated and marked by uneven development that does not necessarily support all farmers participating in the network. This indicates both the fragility and the dynamism inherent in AFNs that are tied to metropolitan development and change. Paradoxically, increasing urban demand for seasonal, and organic produce grown `close to home' and the processes of rural restructuring which emphasize small-scale sustainable family farming and its direct food linkages to cities do not necessarily enable all farmers to consistently make a living from season to season. Evidence for these claims comes from an in-depth, qualitative case study reliant upon participant observation, in-depth interviews and draws from a statewide farmer survey and a regional consumer survey in Washington State.

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to quantify the economic potential of grass-based milk production strategies with limited use of concentrated feed in the pre-alpine region. We monitored 36 family dairy farms from the pre-alpine region of Switzerland divided in three study groups following one of three defined, voluntarily adopted production strategies: Partial grazing and barn feeding with freshly cut forages, supplementing {\textless}500 kg (GBF) and 1,200 kg (GBFplus) of concentrated feed, respectively, and practicing full grazing (FG), supplementing {\textless}100 kg of concentrated feed per cow per year. For three years (2014-2016), data were collected on the farms, and experience and ideas were exchanged and evaluated in a participatory process together with local extension services and researchers. Economic success indicators such as cost price and return to labor from each study group were compared with structurally similar control groups derived from the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network after completing an interactive standardization process, which largely balanced farm-specific features in the study groups. Compared with the control groups, the cost price (Swiss francs [CHF] per 100 kg milk) of GBF, GBFplus, and FG was significantly reduced by 20\%, 20\%, and 26\%, respectively. Return to labor (CHF per hour) was significantly higher than in the control group for GBF (20.60 versus. 13.80), GBFplus (19.70 versus. 10.20), and FG (29.30 versus. 19.20). The comparison between the study groups also showed that lower milk revenues due to a lower use of concentrate could be economically compensated by a better input efficiency. A consistent implementation of the production strategy as well as personal qualities in terms of cost management seems to play a decisive role.},

	abstract = {Child survival depends on the allocation of resources within the household. The size and composition of the sibling set influences parental division of resources and can in turn affect survival chances. In spite of recent advances in research on sibling effects, previous studies have often used the resource dilution hypothesis, which neglects the specific historical context which shapes household structure and organisation. This study therefore focuses specifically on the variation in historical context by examining sibling effects on infant and child mortality in three regions of the Netherlands in the period 1863-1910. It does so by connecting the gendered and the conditional resource-dilution model with each other as a conceptual framework. Changing household composition is taken into account by using longitudinal data from the Historical Sample of the Netherlands, time-varying variables and Cox proportional-hazard models to study sibling size and composition. The results show that the number and gender of siblings play an important role in determining child mortality, but are less significant in determining infant mortality. The number of same-sex siblings has a negative impact on boys' survival chances in the Netherlands, which suggests that after the age of one, boys experienced more competition from their brothers. The reason for this could be their assigned roles within the household and on the family farm. A negative influence of the number of sisters is only found for child mortality chances for girls in the nuclear northwest family region. Here, fewer children were needed to work inside or outside the household, and girls and boys may even have been interchangeable. The results underscore the importance of looking at the interaction between the specific historical context and gender when trying to understand how sibship size and composition influenced children's mortality risks and shaped inequality within the household.},

	abstract = {The conditions required to maintain the techniques and standards used by farmers who fatten Japanese black cattle to produce Maesawa beef, a high-grade Wagyu meat, in Oshu City, Iwate Prefecture, are elucidated. To determine the reproduction mechanism of Maesawa beef, the relationship between labor productivity of fattening farmers and transformations effected in the strains of feeder cattle purchased are investigated, as well feeding methods since the 1990s. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Daily sales per man-day (labor productivity) of Maesawa beef-producing farmers in 1994 can be classified into four types: Type Ia (large-sized, intensive farming enterprises achieving the highest productivity); Type Ib (large- and medium-sized farm businesses engaged in pluri-activity); Type II (full-time farm households retaining two or more workers); and, Type III (medium- and small-sized farms emphasizing the fattening of beef cows). 2. Until the 1990s, Maesawa beef-producing farmers notably tended to purchase feeder cattle, the sires of which belonged to the Tajiri strain, which is endowed with a higher marbling score. However, toward the end of the 1990s, emphasis shifted to gains in the dressed weight of fattened cattle, and farmers began to select bull strains such as Kedaka and Fujiyoshi, which yielded a combination of superior meat quality and a higher average daily gain. The ratio of feeder cattle born and bred in Maesawa District as fattened cattle to those branded Maesawa beef was 1:3. To maintain the locally integrated nature of Maesawa beef production throughout the life cycle, from calves to fattened cattle, Oshu City provided subsidies to fattening farmers who purchased feeder cattle born within the city and to breeding farmers who reserved calves born on their own farms. Recently, some producers of Maesawa beef have entered the breeding business. 3. Knowledge of the self-mixing of individual feeds is only communicated through the generations on family farms, and this specialist know-how helps to maintain higher grades of meat quality. In addition, fattening farmers try to share data on the composition of their feeding rations through organized activities of Iwate Furusato agricultural cooperatives to raise the jomono rate, which is the proportion of dressed carcasses rated Grade 4 or Grade 5. Since the middle-2000s, researchers also observed the increasing use of compound feeds as replacements for self-mixed feeds and the utilization of rolled bales of rice straw to substitute for pole rack-drying straw. Through such changes in the selection of feeder cattle and feed acquisition, Maesawa beef has gained a high market value over the last 25 years. Some surveyed farmers had increased labor productivity by shortening the fattening period and reducing the amount of labor required for feeding.},

	abstract = {In recent years, agricultural extension services in developing countries have increasingly introduced modern information and communication technologies (ICT) to deliver advice. But to realize efficiency gains, digital applications may need to address heterogeneous information needs by targeting agricultural advisory contents in a household-specific way. We explore the feasibility of an automated advisory service that collects household data from farmers, for example through the keypads of conventional mobile phones, and uses this data to prioritize agricultural advisory messages accordingly. To reduce attrition, such a system must avoid lengthy inquiry. Therefore, our objective was to identify a viable trade-off between low data requirements and useful household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages. At three sites in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania independently, we collected experimental preference rankings from smallholder farmers for receiving information about different agricultural and livelihood practices. At each site, we identified socio-economic household variables that improved model-based predictions of individual farmers' information preferences. We used the models to predict household-specific rankings of information options based on 2-4 variables, requiring the farmer to answer between 5 and 10 questions through an ICT interface. These predicted rankings could inform household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages in a digital agro-advisory application. Household-specific “top 3” options suggested by the models were better-fit to farmers' preferences than a random selection of 3 options by 48-68\%, on average. The analysis shows that relatively limited data inputs from fanners, in a simple format, can be used to increase the client-orientation of ICT-mediated agricultural extension. This suggests that household-specific prioritization of agricultural advisory messages through digital two-way communication is feasible. In future digital agricultural advisory applications, collecting little data from farmers at each interaction may feed into learning algorithms that continuously improve the targeting of advice.},

	abstract = {Effective extension systems are vital to smallholder agriculture. Education on sustainable management involves complex interactions and communication flows among information providers and practitioners. Farmer practice is often overlooked within extension knowledge systems, resulting in incompatible recommendations and barriers to sustainable agriculture. This study investigates the diversity of smallholder agricultural practices, with a focus on maize-legume systems in Tanzania, including seasonal cropping patterns and management, as well as linkages to extension recommendations and information flows. We used a mixed methods approach to assess the state of extension and farmer practice around maize-legume production in Tanzania. Household and plot-level survey data (n = 220) and focus group discussions (n = 5) and extension information was ascertained through interviews with key stakeholders (n = 12) and a survey of village-based extension advisors (n = 193). We found legume management practices were highly local. In the Southern Highlands for example, farmers produced from one to three bean crops per year, using a range of planting arrangements. Further, extension recommendations often did not take into account the varieties, fertilizer or plant spacing used by farmers. This comprehensive study of extension knowledge systems in Tanzania highlights the persistent disconnects that occur at multiple levels, acting as a barrier to sustainable intensification of smallholder farming.},

This approach is not always effective and has proved hard to scale sustainably, particularly in highly dispersed smallholder farming systems. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been advanced as a promising way to overcome many of the problems associated with conventional agricultural extension. We evaluate the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated approach to deliver agricultural information in a field experiment conducted among small-scale maize farmers in eastern Uganda. Three complementary technologies designed to address both informational and behavioral constraints to technical change are considered. First, we investigate the effectiveness of audiovisual messages (video) as a means of delivering information on input use and improved maize management practices to farmers. Second, we quantify the additional impact of complementing video with an interactive voice response (IVR) service. Third, we estimate the incremental effect of time-sensitive short message services (SMS) messages designed to remind farmers about applying key practices at specific points during the season. We find that households that were shown a short video on how to become better maize farmers were performing significantly better on a knowledge test, more likely to apply recommended practices, and more likely to use fertilizer than households that did not view the video. These same households also reported maize yields about 10.5\% higher than those that did not view the video. We find little evidence of an incremental effect of the IVR service or SMS reminders.},

	abstract = {In Pakistan, due to the asymmetries in farmers' information access, many ICT-based initiatives have been taken as an alternative to conventional agricultural extension approaches. Recently telecommunication sector of Pakistan has launched farm advisory services for reaching farmers' information needs. This paper analyzed the telecom sector's mobile-based farm advisory services (mFAS) by exploring, provided content, farmers' use, experiences, and its associated factors using the Likert scale and bivariate Probit regression. The study employed a multistage random sampling technique to collect data from the smallholders of Muzaffargarh district of Pakistan. Findings revealed that 70\% of the respondents were subscribed to mFAS. Results further indicated a vast gap between the farmers' access and practical use of provided information in which weather forecast reported the most, while market updates reported the least utilization gap. Similarly, reduced transportation cost was ranked the most, while avoiding potential crop damages was ranked as the least perceived indicators of effectiveness. The study further reported one-way communication mode and farmers' limited skills of mobile phone use as the major constraint in the use of the services. The results of the Probit model found a significant positive relation of farmers' education, credit utilization, and educated family members, while a significant negative relation of farmers' age with the use of mFAS. Based on findings, this study highlights the need for an interactive communication mode, context-specific advisory services, and farmers' training and education for the successful utilization of these services.},

	abstract = {Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools such as videos promoted to enhance farmer access to information to influence change in farming practices need to be situated in social learning processes. Farmers learn and innovate through social learning characterized by exchanges amongst farmers to contextualize knowledge and adapt technologies for relevance. This study assessed how a video-mediated extension approach (VMEA) triggers social learning to enhance innovation among rice farmers in Uganda using experiences of a Non-Government Organization, Sasakawa Global 2000 (SG 2000). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 farmers subjected to VMEA by SC 2000 in Kamwenge district. Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), field observations and key informant interviews were used to collect the quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) while thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data. Results indicate that inherently, videos trigger conversational exchange between farmers including those who do not watch the videos. These interactions enable collective reflection, evaluation and validation of knowledge, which in turn motivate experimentation. In this study, videos significantly enhanced awareness, knowledge acquisition, uptake of technologies and innovation among rice farmers. However, the potential of videos in influencing farmer knowledge and behavioral change can be further exploited if the users can produce contextualized videos of farmer practices and innovations for dissemination. Among other things, effective use of videos in extension requires excellent skills in facilitating social learning processes; and video documentation of farmer practices and innovations to aid scaling up and deepening learning.},

	abstract = {Edutainment, the combination of education with entertainment through various media such as television, radio, mobile phone applications and games, is increasingly being used as an approach to stimulate innovation and increase agricultural productivity amongst smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Shamba Shape Up, a widely publicised makeover reality TV programme, is an example of edutainment that has received considerable attention, and airs in three countries in East Africa where it is estimated to be watched by millions of viewers. There is no published academic research on the influence of makeover television formats on innovation systems and processes in smallholder agriculture. Using an Agricultural Innovation Systems approach, this paper explores how makeover edutainment is influencing smallholder farmer innovation systems together with the effect this is having on smallholder farms. In the absence of previous research, it articulates a Theory of Change which draws on research traditions from mass communication, agricultural extension and innovation systems. Data came from two large scale quantitative (n = 9885 and n = 1572) surveys, and in-depth participatory qualitative research comprising focus group discussions, participatory budgets, agricultural timelines, case studies and key information interviews in Kenya. An estimated 430,000 farmers in the study area were benefiting from their interaction with the programme through increased income and/or a range of related social benefits including food security, improving household health, diversification of livelihood choices, paying school fees for children and increasing their community standing/social capital. Participatory research showed SSU enhanced an already rich communication environment and strengthened existing processes of innovation. It helped set the agenda for discussions within farming communities about opportunities for improving smallholder farms, while also giving specific ideas, information and knowledge, all in the context of featured farm families carefully selected so that a wide range of viewers would identify with them and their challenges. Broadcasts motivated and inspired farmers to improve their own farms through a range of influences including entertainment, strong empathy with the featured host farm families, the way ideas emerged through interaction with credible experts, and importantly through stimulating widespread discussion and interaction amongst and between farmers and communities of experts on agricultural problems, solutions and opportunities. The fact that local extension workers also watched the programmes further enhanced the influence on local innovation systems. The findings indicate that well designed makeover edutainment can strongly influence agricultural innovation processes and systems resulting in impact on the agricultural production and behaviours of large numbers of smallholder farmers.},

	abstract = {This research identifies critical determinants for interactions between farmers and extension agencies. Cross-sectional farm household-level data from three hundred household heads were collected between September 2019 and March 2020 and triangulated with data from workshops with farmers and extension agents. The data were analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and the ordered probit model. Farmers' socio-economic characteristics significantly affect their degree of interaction with extension agencies. Recognition of the determinants of the level of farmers' interactions can inform policymakers about how to formulate and improve the effectiveness of extension programs, enhance information and knowledge dissemination and facilitate development in collaboration with local communities by focusing on a better interaction between farmers and extension agencies. The level of a farmer's interactions is based on a systematic decision-making process. Although personal and demographic characteristics are important, farmers' interaction levels require conducive institutional and household assets, groups/social capital and access to extension agents' contexts. These contexts will differ by household, country and region. Therefore, extension agencies should create and design contextually appropriate strategies for substantial interactions with farmers for the dissemination of farm information. This research is original and valuable in identifying the factors associated with the level of farmers' interactions with extension agencies in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. It also provides a new pathway for operationalizing farmer-oriented agricultural extension policies and strategies and to help agricultural policymakers formulate extension service programs.},

Resource and infrastructure challenges often limit the ability of programs to expand through the use of extension and other forms of in-person training. Although media such as radio, television, and mobile phones cannot replace the value of interpersonal communication, they can offer a low-cost alternative for reaching large audiences in even some of the most remote regions. With the increasing use of media for sustainable development come questions relating to the ability of these channels to move beyond a one-way flow of information to include and respond to local knowledge and experiences and to create dialogue, both farmer to farmer and between farmers and designers of educational messaging. This article evaluates the role of media in promoting sustainable agriculture in Zambia. Specifically, the findings present qualitative feedback from 34 smallholder farmers targeted by Community Markets for Conservation's current radio programming efforts around sustainable agriculture. Results demonstrate the centrality of the radio program alongside other forms of communication, such as extension and farmer-to-farmer communication, as well as written and visual communication. These findings consider direct and indirect exposure to these efforts and the importance of radio in offering a foundation for dialogue and increased social diffusion of sustainable innovations in remote regions.},

	abstract = {A farmer or a dairy consultant's ability to identify and properly treat lame dairy cows is key to managing lameness on farms. However, this ability is dependent on their knowledge and perceptions regarding lameness. To date these topics are poorly understood in all dairy systems. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a qualitative approach to describe the perception of lameness in Brazilian pasture-based dairy farms. The aim of this study was firstly, to contextualize farmers and dairy consultants' culture and knowledge on the topic of lameness and, secondly, to understand how these factors may influence lameness management on the farms. Indepth face-to-face semi-structured interviews were done with participating farm owners (n = 21) and dairy consultants (n = 13). Thematic analyses of the interview content provided evidence that the dairy community's overarching culture around lameness acts as a barrier preventing positive actions targeting lameness control and prevention. The emerging themes identified indicate that lameness is a vague, ill-defined concept among both farmers and dairy consultants working in this region. There was a shared belief that pasture-based systems have a low risk for lameness. Furthermore, the prevailing culture for tackling lameness was reactive, particularly in the case of lame cows affected by physical trauma or environmental factors. Treatment was frequently delayed and the misuse of antibiotics was evident. Described community culture was rationalised via the cognitive dissonance and health belief models. We suggest that increased dialogue, including educational efforts within the community, may lead to increased sensitivity of risk perception of lameness within the community and in turn trigger appropriate diagnosis and treatment of lame cows.},

	abstract = {We consider the question of what is needed for climate services to support sub-Saharan African farmers' adaptation needs at the scale of the climate challenge. Consistent with an earlier assessment that mutually reinforcing supply-side and demand-side capacity constraints impede the development of effective climate services in Africa, our discussion of strategies for scaling up practices that meet farmers' needs, and opportunities to address long-standing obstacles, is organized around: (a) meeting farmers' climate information needs; (b) supporting access, understanding and use; and (c) co-production of services. A widespread gap between available information and farmers' needs is associated with entrenched seasonal forecast convention and obstacles to using observational data. Scalable innovations for producing more locally relevant historical and forecast climate information for farm decision-making are beginning to be adopted. Structured participatory communication processes help farmers relate complex climate information to their experience, and integrate it into their management decisions. Promising efforts to deliver rural climate services strategically combine communication channels that include participatory processes embedded in existing agricultural advisory systems, and innovations in interactive broadcast media. Efforts to engage farmers in co-production of climate services improve delivery to farmers and dialogue among stakeholders, but often with little impact on the usability of available information. We discuss challenges and options for capturing farmers' evolving demands, and aggregating and incorporating this information into iterative improvements to climate services at a national scale. We find evidence that key weaknesses in the supply and the demand sides of climate services continue to reinforce each other to impede progress toward meeting farmers' needs at scale across Africa. Six recommendations target these weaknesses: (1) change the way seasonal forecasts are produced and presented regionally and nationally, (2) use merged gridded data as a foundation for national climate information products, (3) remove barriers to using historical data as a public good, (4) mobilize those who work on the demand side of climate services as an effective community of practice, (5) collectively assess and improve tools and processes for communicating climate information with rural communities, and (6) build iterative co-production processes into national climate service frameworks.},

The study characterized climate hazards related to crop and livestock production in marginal areas of Zimbabwe based on field observations. The study was carried out using a participatory and interactive survey approach. The climatic related risks impinging on livestock and cereal production in communal areas were outlined. A tailored seasonal climate forecast system, based on farmers' contextual knowledge and conventional approaches, for smallholder farmers aimed at providing information relevant for the management of climate-related production risks was developed. Thus, local knowledge which made farming possible in the past, through pre-season and intra-season farm management strategies under harsh climatic conditions needs to be appreciated and fused into new climate systems. The study recommends that Agricultural Extension Workers should communicate agro-meteorological information that is usable by conservation farmers to manage their food production from an informed position. Local Agricultural Extension Workers should identify and provide key local coping strategies where the tailored forecast could be useful to the farmers since they are strategically positioned in relation to the farmers' environment.},

	abstract = {Background Pesticides can have negative effects on human and environmental health, especially when not handled as intended. In many countries, agro-input dealers sell pesticides to smallholder farmers and are supposed to provide recommendations on application and handling. This study investigates the role of agro-input dealers in transmitting safety information from chemical manufacturers to smallholder farmers, assesses the safety of their shops, what products they sell, and how agro-input dealers abide by laws and recommendations on best practices for preventing pesticide risk situations. Methods Applying a mixed-methods approach, we studied agro-input dealers in Central and Western Uganda. Structured questionnaires were applied to understand agro-input dealers' knowledge, attitude and practices on pesticides (n = 402). Shop layout (n = 392) and sales interaction (n = 236) were assessed through observations. Actual behavior of agro-input dealers when selling pesticides was revealed through mystery shopping with local farmers buying pesticides (n = 94). Results While 97.0\% of agro-input dealers considered advising customers their responsibility, only 26.6\% of mystery shoppers received any advice from agro-input dealers when buying pesticides. 53.2\% of products purchased were officially recommended. Sales interactions focused mainly on product choice and price. Agro-input dealers showed limited understanding of labels and active ingredients. Moreover, 25.0\% of shops were selling repackaged products, while 10.5\% sold unmarked or unlabeled products. 90.1\% of shops were lacking safety equipment. Pesticides of World Health Organization toxicity class I and II were sold most frequently. Awareness of health effects seemed to be high, although agro-input dealers showed incomplete hygiene practices and were lacking infrastructure. One reason for these findings might be that only 55.7\% of agro-input dealers held a certificate of competency on safe handling of pesticides and even fewer (5.7\%) were able to provide a government-approved up-to-date license. Conclusion The combination of interviews, mystery shopping and observations proved to be useful, allowing the comparison of stated and actual behavior. While agro-input dealers want to sell pesticides and provide the corresponding risk advice, their customers might receive neither the appropriate product nor sufficient advice on proper handling. In light of the expected increase in pesticide use, affordable, accessible and repeated pesticide training and shop inspections are indispensable.},

	abstract = {The location of properties holding livestock is fluid; edging towards the boundaries of urban Australia, increasing the likelihood that veterinarians will be exposed to livestock as part of the provision of routine veterinary services. This study was conducted to ascertain the challenges, knowledge level and training needs of veterinarians working within this landscape, with the ultimate aim of informing the development of resources and training to better equip them in this capacity. For this purpose, a cross-sectional study, using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among Australian veterinarians. The questionnaire comprised a mixture of 47 short closed, semi-closed and open-ended questions and was available for electronic distribution. Data was analysed descriptively and logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential factors associated with knowledge and practices of veterinarians in relation to smallholders. Complete responses were obtained from 91 veterinarians. The main livestock species kept by smallholder clients were sheep, goats, and cattle; with on-farm visits reported the most frequent interaction type, and responding to emergency situations the most frequently performed activity. The challenges experienced by veterinarians when working with smallholders were mostly related to external factors such as; lack of facilities, lack of client knowledge on animal health management and client's financial constraints. Over 95\% of respondents provided some level of biosecurity advice and zoonotic disease information as part of their routine veterinary service. Although veterinarians provide advice and support to smallholders, only 14.5\% considered themselves to be highly influential on smallholder practices. Confidence level in investigating disease differed by livestock species, with lower confidence reported in pigs, poultry and alpaca. Respondents were open to receiving assistance to support smallholders on matters related to disease, welfare or biosecurity, with other veterinarians (government and private), reported as the most frequently utilised resource. Having access to materials that could be distributed to smallholders was considered to be an effective way in which to provide information. While the risk of zoonotic disease was considered a challenge associated with working with smallholders, respondent's use of personal protective equipment (PPE), whilst performing common veterinary activities, was in many instances inadequate. Similarly, vaccination levels among veterinarians and other workers within the veterinary practice to prevent zoonotic diseases were variable. This study provides an insight into the way in which veterinarians engage with smallholders and highlight the importance of providing both groups with the tools necessary to manage the livestock to which are exposed.},

	abstract = {We assessed the effectiveness of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology in delivering biosecurity messages for the control of African swine fever (ASF) in Uganda using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 408 smallholder pig farmers. Our results show that IVR technology significantly improved knowledge of farmers who had not been exposed to training on biosecurity. Furthermore, it enhanced knowledge for farmers who had received face-to-face (f2f) training in biosecurity. This group of farmers recorded the highest knowledge gain following IVR training compared to farmers who did not receive f2f training. IVR technology was perceived by farmers as a new technology capable of transforming their lives because it is time efficient, has high potential for resource saving and flexibility. IVR also seems to be gender sensitive as it addresses some of the constraints women face in accessing conventional extension services such as time. IVR is an innovative way for delivery of advisory information to pig farmers. The scalability of IVR technology could further be explored and its feasibility assessed for wider use by the extension systems in Uganda and elsewhere.},

Recent initiatives to address gender unequal access to agricultural information have been clumsy, overlooking participatory approaches that focus on transformative change. This study uses Pakistani rural advisory services to compare farmers' and extension workers' perceptions of access to agricultural information, to identify culturally acceptable gender-responsive schemes. Design/methodology/approach:One-hundred and eleven extension workers in Pakistan's public rural advisory services were interviewed and crosstabulated with farmers' answers in previous studies. Findings:Male extension workers are aware that women access less information less often; however they might not be aware of its importance in the gender inequality debate. Lead farmers could offer a potentially transformative knowledge pathway because of its blend of formal and informal interactions - both systems favoured by female smallholders. An exclusively female-led lead farmer approach could be developed and trialled in specific areas of the province. Practical implications:Targeted initiatives focusing on improving awareness and importance of gender inequalities in information access as well as specific extension system development centred on lead female farmers and extension agents are important in institutionalising gender and creating transformative change. Theoretical implications:Linking these activities to in-depth social network and agricultural innovation system analyses would provide further evidence of the importance of focused gender activities and their impact on food security. Originality/value:This paper highlights the importance of analysing individual perceptions to understand the types of initiatives that could be considered for a wider institutionalisation of gender in RAS.},

It addresses opinions on the inclusion of climate change mitigation strategies (such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest DegradationREDD+) into cocoa production, and potential obstacles and roles of stakeholders in ensuring community acceptance of such strategies in a unique multiple land use areathe Krokosua Hills Forest Reserve. Data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency and through survey of 205 cocoa farmers were assessed with Mann-Kendall, Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Farmers' perceptions of changes in climate were notably diverse and did not always match historic weather data, but accurately described increases in temperature and drought which are linked to cocoa productivity. Farmers appreciate the importance of tree maintenance for ecosystem services but were skeptical of financially rewarding climate change strategies which favor tree protection. Cultural practices associated with cocoa production encourage carbon release and may pose a threat to the objectives of REDD+. Farmers' experience on the land, interactions with other farmers, government extension agents and cocoa buyers all influence cocoa agroforestry practices in the area, and communication through existing entities (particularly extension agents) presents a pathway to community acceptance of climate change mitigation strategies. The study recommends reforms in REDD+ strategies to adopt flexible and participatory frameworks to facilitate adoption and acceptability due to pronounced heterogeneity in community perceptions and knowledge of climate change and related issues.},

	abstract = {Agricultural engineering (AE) is one of the disciplines that have been adversely affected by declining enrolments and popularity among school leavers, especially in developed countries. Efforts to reverse the downward trend must consider curriculum changes, which broaden the currently narrow and shrinking sources and catchment areas of potential fresh student intakes, as well as providing them with skills for lifelong learning and employment opportunities beyond the agricultural sector. This article examines some of the current perceptions and trends in AE education, and proposes a global orientation to a curriculum that equips undergraduate students with integrative skills in applied sciences, engineering principles and emerging technologies. A triad of emerging technological innovations that are driving the knowledge economy is identified and recommended for inclusion in an AE educational curriculum. The new AE education paradigm will enable graduates and professionals to shift the historical emphasis from `on-farm mechanization' to the development and application of new innovations to support knowledge-intensive and information-driven agriculture. Effective communication and dialogue with key stakeholders, and implementing adequate response to emerging technological, environmental and economic challenges facing agriculture are critical to winning public support and improving the appeal of AE among school leavers and industries. Strategies that include changing the current name Of educational AE programmes and/or professional societies must be pursued with considerable caution if the profession is to remain truly global and to facilitate the international mobility of future agricultural engineers in an increasingly globalized labour market. The prospects for innovative engineering inputs for transforming smallholder agriculture in least developed countries are discussed.},

	abstract = {Ugandan smallholder farmers need to feed a growing population, but their efforts are hampered by declining soil fertility rates. Agricultural extension can facilitate farmers' access to new practices and technologies, yet farmers are understandably often hesitant to adopt new behaviors. New knowledge assimilation is an important component of behavior change that is often overlooked or poorly addressed by current extension efforts. We implemented a Fertility Management Education Program (FMEP) in central Uganda to investigate smallholder farmers' existing soil knowledge and their assimilation of new scientific concepts into their knowledge framework. Qualitative data were collected through participant observation, farmer interviews, and focus groups, and coded for using a priori and emergent themes. Our exploration revealed some notable similarities between farmers' soil knowledge and scientific concepts, particularly in regards to soil health concepts, a discovery that could facilitate communication between extension agents and farmers. However, certain scientific concepts are either unknown to farmers or discordant with existing soil knowledge; these concepts are unlikely to be assimilated by farmers without convincing and concerted extension efforts. Importantly, we found that the combination of new scientific knowledge and hands-on experimentation with novel practices gave farmers far greater confidence in implementing improved soil management practices. Our study provides evidence that extension programs should engage directly with farmers' existing soil knowledge to develop their understanding of key biological concepts and confidence in implementing improved practices.},

	abstract = {The overall willingness of smallholder farmers to adopt new green technologies remains low, in spite of the great progress made in understanding the factors that affect their decision. The present study introduces an interdisciplinary approach combining positive psychology and sustainable development studies to show that two personal resources - self-control (a learned repertoire of goal-directed skills that enable people to act upon their aims) and cognitive goal-oriented hope (the ability to follow different routes to pursue one's goal), prompt the adoption of technologies by smallholder farmers. Both personal resources facilitate achieving future goals and changing existing circumstances. A theoretical moderation model on the adoption of agricultural technologies aimed to protect soil degradation in Nepal is proposed and empirically tested. Data were collected from 268 households in the Jhapa district by a face-to-face questionnaire. A multiple regression analysis tested and confirmed the hypothesized moderation model. Following the discovery of a significant interaction, the nature of the interaction was farther explored by calculating simple slopes. Analysis results show a significant positive connection between self-control (p-value = 0.002), hope (p-value = 0.005), information (p-value {\textless} 0.001), and technology adoption. Self-control was also found to have a significant moderating effect in enhancing a positive association between receiving information and technology adoption (p-value = 0.017). In addition to its theoretical innovation and empirical contribution, the importance of this study lies in its practical implications, given that policy, education, and communication may influence hope and self-control levels.},

Recently the demand for information on agricultural practices and technology among the farmers is increasing day by day but fulfilment of these demands exclusively by public agricultural extension system is limited. To address this challenge, information communication technology (ICT) has the immense role in supplementing the extension system. Among the ICT tools, mobile phone, because of its affordability, accessibility, minimum skill requirement, widespread network etc., has emerged as important tool for information and knowledge dissemination to the smallholder and marginal farmers. But it is necessary to study how effective they are in achieving the respective objectives.The present investigation was conducted to study the effectiveness of mKRISHI (R) PAWS (Personalised Advisory on Water and Soil) in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand state. An ex-post facto research design was used for this study. Total 136 messages were sent to the respondents. The data was collected from 240 beneficiary farmers of the north-western Himalayan region. The effectiveness of the mKRISHI (R) PAWS in technology advisory and delivery services were measured by developing an effectiveness index for the purpose. Results showed that 93.8\% of farmers perceive that quality of information regarding the latest NRM technologies in soil and water conservation was excellent and 83.75\% of the farmers felt that the information regarding the latest NRM technologies in soil and water conservation was appropriate to their condition. The study revealed that the extension services delivered by mKRISHI (R) PAWS were found to be highly effective by majority of the farmers. 34.58\% fanners perceived that the mKRISHI (R) PAWS was very highly effective as a mean of getting their information needs.},

	abstract = {Knowledge-based development interventions for improved natural resource management have long advocated for the integration of local and outsiders' knowledge. Participatory and conventional approaches frame this as a dialogue between “local” and “scientific” knowledges, using the relative strengths of each stakeholder's experience to reinforce knowledge gaps. While the epistemological and methodological challenges of such dialogue are well-documented, this study uses a community-based learning project for integrated soil fertility management in western Kenya to explore the less understood dynamics of dissonance between and within knowledge systems. While participatory research did build a dynamic expertise for soil fertility management shared by both smallholder farmers and scientists, divergent expectations and understandings emerged after the initial enthusiasm of shared learning. This included scientists assessing farmers as “not very good” researchers and farmers seeing researchers as “not very good” farmers. Dissonances between actors' different understandings of soil, the research process, and each other had multiple implications, including on the validity of conclusions reached by different actors and on the possibility for scientific support for local experimentation. While many dissonances ultimately fueled learning and improvements to the project, this required both farmers and scientists to move beyond initial critiques of each other's knowledge and practices. At their worst, dissonant knowledge claims were actually political ones, hiding competition for control of the development process. Recognizing the nature and extent of dissonances is therefore a crucial step in understanding how best to apply limited resources and disciplinary expertise within participatory teams attempting to build hybrid knowledge.

Achieving SI requires smallholder farmers to have access to information that is context-specific, increases their decision-making capacities, and adapts to changing environments.

In order to enhance the public extension service in Tanzania, we created a digital service that addresses smallholder farmers' different information needs for implementing SI. Using a co-design methodology - User-Centered Design - we elicited feedback from farmers and extension agents in Tanzania to create a new digital information service, called Ushauri. This automated hotline gives farmers access to a set of pre-recorded messages. Additionally, farmers can ask questions in a mailbox. Extension agents then listen to these questions through an online platform, where they record and send replies via automated push-calls. A test with 97 farmers in Tanzania showed that farmers actively engaged with the service to access agricultural advice. Extension agents were able to answer questions with reduced workload compared to conventional communication channels. This study illustrates how User-Centered Design can be used to develop information services for complex and resource-restricted smallholder farming contexts.},

The study investigates how gender dynamics interact with the agricultural extension delivery with particular reference to the adoption of improved technologies. A total sample of 592 smallholder farmers were interviewed in selected communities in Northern Ghana. In addition to one-on-one interviews, 18 focus group discussions were also conducted in the surveyed districts. Study findings confirmed that male farmers had more access to agricultural extension delivery than their female counterparts because of their relatively better financial standing, large farm sizes, mobility to access extension and rural advisory service providers outside their communities. The study identified gendered associations with some crop types across all the study districts. However, the gendered extension delivery led to a new sociocultural order that seems to break down the gendered associations with the adoption of improved technologies.},

Our findings indicate that when introducing mobile-based tools, focus should be given to younger, more educated farmers growing more specialized crops. The main constraints to adopt agricultural apps are lack of access to smartphone and/or internet (63\%) and lack of digital knowledge (20\%). However, smallholder farmers in Myanmar were optimistic and positive toward agricultural apps for effective utilization.

To achieve these benefits, knowledge of the local context is needed to inform information development, delivery, and use. We examine coffee farming in the Jamaican Blue Mountains (BM) to understand farmer livelihoods, opportunities for climate knowledge to benefit coffee production, and the factors that impinge on farmers' ability to use climate information. Our analysis draws on interviews and 12 focus groups involving 143 participants who largely cultivate small plots. BM farmers currently experience stresses related to climate, coffee leaf rust, and production costs that interrelate concurrently and with time lags. Under conditions that reduce income, BM farmers compensate by adjusting their use of inputs, which can increase their susceptibility to future climate and disease stresses. However, farmers can also decrease impacts of future stressors by more efficiently and effectively allocating their limited resources. In this sense, managing climate, like the other stresses, is an ongoing process. While we identify climate products that can help farmers manage climate risk, the local context presents barriers that argue for interactive climate services that go beyond conventional approaches of information production and delivery. We discuss how dialogs between farmers, extension personnel, and climate scientists can create a foundation from which use can emerge.},

On this rationale, this study was carried out to explore the applicability of the concept of converging `Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)' to promote sustainable knowledge sharing amongst the agricultural communities in Sri Lanka. A multi-stage community consultative process with a set of designated officials (”Sponsors”) and a series of semi-structured questionnaire survey with a cross section of smallholder agriculture farmers (n=246), were carried out in the Batticaloa, Kurunegala and Puttalam districts to gather the baseline data. This was followed by a number of field experiments (”Campaigns”) with the farmers (n=340) from same geographical areas. The two FOSS, namely: (1) “FrontlineSMS” for `Text Messaging' and (2) “FreedomFone” for `Interactive Voice Responses', were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge sharing within the farming communities. It was found that FOSS intervention increases the `Text messaging' and `Voice Call' usage in day-to-day agricultural communication by 26 and 8 percent, respectively. The demographic factors like age and educational level of the farmers have a positive influence on the knowledge sharing process. And also the `Mobile Telephony' was the most extensive mode of communication within the communities. The outcome of analysis, as a whole, implies that, with a fitting mechanism in place, this approach can be promoted as a “drive for positive changes” in agriculture-based rural communities in developing countries like Sri Lanka, and those in South and East Asia with similar socioeconomic and cultural perspectives.},

	abstract = {Access to agricultural education is critical for farmers to maintain sustainable and profitable agricultural enterprises. Yet African American farmers have historically faced obstacles in gaining equal access to educational resources, due in part to the communicative frameworks through which agricultural knowledge is transmitted. Framing agricultural education as a communicative event, this paper examines the process of knowledge transmission itself as practiced by a grassroots organization dedicated to overcoming educational disparities by providing educational programs and resources for African American farmers. This paper draws on research gathered through ethnographic methods, including collaborative filmmaking. Collaborative filmmaking provided both a means to focus on the performative, tacit, and embodied components of the educational process and a tool for discussing interpretations and the relevance of the educational programs with participants. Drawing on this research, this paper argues that while it is important for all extension agents and educators to pay attention to communicative frameworks, intermediary organizations play an important role in providing critical and accessible agricultural education to local communities. Intermediary organizations and local educational programs can utilize local discourses, engage tacit and symbolic knowledge, serve as translators between mainstream educational resources and local communities, and provide specific knowledge for the goals of local communities.},

Thirty-six farmers who visited a plant clinic in one of three countries (Malawi, Costa Rica and Nepal) were given at least one diagnosis of a plant health problem and up to six options for managing the problem. Almost all of the farmers were able to use at least some of these management recommendations. Communication was verbal, but reinforced in writing; all of the farmers received a one-page prescription form that summarized the recommendation. Communication per se was rarely the reason farmers failed to adopt technologies. Farmers who opted not to use recommendations often had logical, material reasons for doing so, and they showed a preference for chemical control. Of the 31 farmers who were advised to apply pesticides (including organic ones), 23 people (74\%) accepted this advice to spray, but only 14 of 22 farmers (54\%) tried advice for cultural or biological control. Farmers' response to an innovation is too complex to always describe as accepted vs rejected, and this decision depends on the fit of the technology itself, and on the quality of how the innovation is communicated.},

Even in very poor communities, radio penetration is vast; it is estimated there are over 800 million radios in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper summarizes evidence on food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa and strategies to provide information on innovative agricultural practices to smallholder farmers. The research in this paper is then discussed within the context of research on information and communication technologies (ICTS) for development. Next, the paper presents the ICT-enhanced participatory radio campaign approach and ICT innovations introduced by Farm Radio International, a Canadian nongovernmental organization. The paper analyzes two participatory radio campaigns that use both listening groups and ICTs to engage African farmers. Research on these radio campaigns in six African countries is reported to examine how the participatory approach impacted listenership, knowledge and initial adoption of agricultural techniques and practices presented in the radio campaigns. The authors conclude that the findings of research on these projects could be highly relevant for increasing awareness and adoption of agricultural practices in Sub-Saharan Africa. They also appear promising for other development sectors and for other developing regions.},

Findings reveal significant pitfalls in PVS that resulted from emergence of spoiler factors such as new crop disease and unpredictable floods. Spoiler factors curtailed sustainability of participatory gains. Besides, learning during critical,field stages was thin due to participatory lapses. For instance, an average of only 8\% (total = 1488) consistently participated in each key stage of PVS learning trials in western Kenya. The majority (92\%) participated on average once, especially in the end-of-season field day when final ranking of crop varieties was done. Consequently, this majority engaged in impulse buying, due to poor grasp of salient productivity factors underlying attractive traits of the new germplasm. Essentially, post-PVS sustainability conditions were elusive. Scaling out of PVS gains was hence compromised and early adopters often fell back to old varieties, to experience, or to sporadic extension advice. PVS therefore has to be anchored within an integrated knowledge exchange system that addresses challenges emanating from interaction of smallholder social, spatial and temporal contexts.

	abstract = {The importance of extension services in helping smallholder farmers to address the many challenges of agricultural production cannot be over-emphasized. However, relatively few studies have been conducted that investigate how the capacities of agricultural extension agents can be built to more effectively assist smallholder farmers in managing climate risks and impacts. As climate change is a key threat to smallholder food production, addressing this issue is increasingly important. This paper aims to identify how agricultural extension agents in Ghana can better support smallholder farmers in navigating and addressing the effects of climate change on food production. It asks: (i) what are the sources of information used by agricultural extension agents in Ghana's Upper East region? (ii) what are the capacity building needs of agricultural extension agents for effective communication of climate information for building resilient agricultural systems? (iii) what are the key barriers to successful extension outcomes for climate change adaptation? The paper uses a mixed methods approach including three regional stakeholder workshops, expert interviews and surveys with 32 agricultural extension agents in northeastern Ghana. Results addressing question (i) indicated that radios and television are the dominant sources of climate information for agricultural extension agents in the Upper East region. Findings targeting question (ii) identified capacity building needs such as developing extension agents' technical skills, improving communication skills, improving knowledge and use of climate smart agricultural interventions such as soil moisture conservation methods, and training on information communication technologies (ICT) to deliver extension advice on climate change. Other needs included developing skills in field demonstration and project monitoring and evaluation. Addressing question (iii), key barriers confronted by agricultural extension agents in the delivery of extension on climate change included lack of transportation facilities for extension agents, lack of appropriate extension materials, high agricultural extension agent to farmer ratios, and inadequate funds to implement adaptation practices. Wider barriers reducing the effectiveness of extension efforts included farmer resistance to change and complex land tenure arrangements that do not allow investment. Periodic workshops should be organised for agricultural extension agents on the use of ICT to deliver extension services, whilst encouraging the use of audio-visuals in extension delivery. These efforts should be supported by regular assessments of extension agents' capacity building needs.},

	abstract = {Description of the subject. To boost the development of the national palm oil sector, one of the most promising moves for the Cameroonian government would be to improve partnerships between agro-industries and smallholders in order to increase the latter's plantation yields and oil extraction rates. Objectives. Drawing on successful experiences in Southeast Asia, this paper examines the conditions for establishing a winwin partnership between agro-industrial companies and smallholders in the Cameroonian palm oil sector. Method. The study was carried out in three production basins in the Centre and the Southwest regions of Cameroon where such partnerships were initiated before the collapse of the National Aid Fund for Rural Development (FONADER) in the 1970s. In participatory workshops involving at least twelve stakeholders (palm oil producers, artisanal and industrial millers, intermediaries and agricultural extension services), the participants' knowledge was integrated together through individual and collective reflection, with a guarantee of equal expression and consideration of views. Two workshops followed a strict adaptation of Participatory Prospective Analysis (PPA); a third followed a semi-directed participatory approach. Interactions between participants produced definitions of the systems studied and the variables involved, different plausible future scenarios, and recommendations for decision making. Results. Access to technical and managerial capacity building, terms of the contract, access to shareholding in the company by smallholders, and legalization of the terms of the contract emerged as the major items that would influence a sustainable partnership between agro-industries and smallholders. Conclusions. Participatory derived recommendations show that long-term partnerships between agro-industry and smallholders depend on a negotiated contract agreement between the partners to ensure transparency and trust. In addition, a dedicated smallholder department in charge of village plantations within agro-industrial companies can facilitate communication between partners.},

	abstract = {Purpose Ethiopia operates a large agricultural extension service system. However, access to extension-related knowledge, technologies and agricultural inputs is unequally distributed among smallholder farmers. Social learning is widely practiced by most farmers to cope with this unequal distribution though its practices have hardly been documented in passing on knowledge of agriculture and rural development or embedding it into the local system of knowledge production, transfer and use. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to identify the different methods of social learning, as well as their contribution to the adoption and diffusion of technologies within Ethiopia's smallholder agricultural setting. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods approach was used, comprising farmer and expert interviews, focus group discussions, informal individual discussions and key informant interviews. The data were documented, coded and later analyzed using SPSS and ATLAS.ti. Findings The findings showed that 55 per cent of the farmers in the studied areas fully relied on social, community-level learning to adopt agricultural technologies, while 35 per cent of them relied on social learning only partly. Farmers acquired knowledge through social networks by means of communication, observation, collective labor groups, public meetings, socio-cultural events and group socialization. Informal institutions such as iddir, debo and dado, helped farmers learn, adopt and diffuse technologies. Originality/value This study used the concept of epistemic oppression by Dotson (2014) as a conceptual framework to examine farmers' access to extension services and to analyze how informal institutions serve as workplace learning for the smallholder farmers. The authors suggest community-level social learning serves as a coping mechanism against the prevailing limitations of the formal extension system, and at the same time, it guards against the deepening of social, political and epistemic inequalities that are inherent to the knowledge system.},

Extension communication, particularly, has a large bearing on the sustainability of agricultural developments projects. The apparent lack of information, education and training during the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) of Zimbabwe contributed to low agricultural production and productivity which could consequently lead to continuing food insecurity in the country. The findings indicate a discrepancy between work experience and qualifications of the extension workers which could imply a lack in the quality of knowledge, information and skills imparted to the resettled farmers. Further findings indicate a lack of stakeholder analysis in designing agricultural communication projects and an absence of a multi-media communication approach to enhance adoption of agricultural innovations. The study concludes that agricultural extension is not adequate due to multiple resource constraints. The findings imply that agricultural communication should be integrative. A model of smallholder agriculture stakeholder mobilization has been developed to encourage effective agricultural communication and productivity therein.},

	abstract = {Climate change is likely to generate severe impacts on smallholder farmers in developing countries. As key drivers of adaptation, climate risk perceptions are highly heterogeneous, varying both across people and context, and are complex, being defined as behaviour which varies across both impact and likelihood dimensions in nonlinear ways. Yet most studies examining risk perceptions are unable to disentangle the role of perceptions regarding impacts from those regarding the likelihood of climate-related events taking place. This paper presents a decomposition and associated analysis of survey-based `risk perception' measures. The decomposition we apply allows independent accounting for perceptions over frequencies and impacts linking to behavioural patterns of risk attitude. The approach presented here draws on a detailed 2017 survey of 500 farmers in rural Indonesia to generate insights into the relationship between risk perceptions and extension services, accessibility of information, and other factors. Results show that risk perceptions are generated from complex interaction between perceived future frequencies and outcomes of climate events and indicate differential impacts of extension services across these perceptions. This paper also presents empirical support for the use of information and communication technology based extension as an efficient extension tool to reach more farmers than in traditional methods.},

	abstract = {Many smallholders in Nepal rely on marginal lands that are subject to declining fertility due in part to traditional farming practices. The adoption of conservation agriculture practices has the potential to improve livelihoods and food security but depends on knowledge sharing among farmers, extension agents, and researchers. This study uses Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine farmer, extension professional, and researcher preferences for selected conservation agriculture production systems (CAPS) and a widely-practiced traditional production system. This data is then used to determine which CAPS have the highest likelihood of adoption and identify misunderstandings or knowledge gaps among farmers, extension personnel and scientists. AHP was conducted in three tribal villages and at two NGOs that provide research and extension services to smallholders in the central Middle Hills region of Nepal. Overall, soil quality was identified as the most important factor affecting long-term household income, the primary motivator of adoption in study villages. Farmers generally preferred full tillage followed by cowpea solo crop in the second growing season while extension agents and researchers preferred strip tillage followed by cowpea and millet intercrop in the second season. Results indicate that (I) stakeholders prefer CAPS over traditional systems, (2) farmers prefer full tillage over minimum tillage and (3) the farmers in the village of Khola Gaun may be more prepared to adopt minimum tillage and intercropping than the other villages. Communication among all stakeholders should be improved and the results of on-farm plots should be used to reinforce understanding of CAPS benefits. It should be kept in mind that labor savings is not a main motivator of adoption among village farmers and further research should be conducted in Khola Gaun to learn why farmer preferences there differ significantly from farmer preferences in other villages.

Given the prominence of female agriculturalists in Malawi, such focus has can make a large impact on the country's rural sustainable development. This study quantifies the impact of extension techniques, including lead farmers, NGO trainers, and farmer clubs, on men and women farmers in Malawi by applying ordered logistic regression to data concerning postextension increases in self-assessed CSA knowledge. Male and female farmers achieved increases in knowledge through traditional extension (NGO trainers and farmer clubs). However, these gains were less for female farmers. The interaction of female farmers with lead farmers (i.e. community members trained to train others) made increases in knowledge more likely. The impact of lead farmers was lessened by limited mobility and availability. Based on the study findings, we advocate for innovative approaches to CSA extension that aim to increase understanding of differing needs and preferences of female farmers. A failure to include women farmers in design from the outset misses a key opportunity to develop understanding of related societal challenges, increasing the likelihood of nominal participation and uneven outcomes among participating farmers},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development, design, dissemination and evaluation of a communication intervention designed to promote appropriate usage of trypanocidal drugs in trypanosomiasis endemic areas of western and coastal Kenya. Following a baseline study on current trypanosomiasis knowledge, attitudes and practices by smallholder farmers, a communication intervention strategy was developed involving dissemination through school children, village elders, animal health centres and Agrovet shops, and using layered messages in posters and leaflets. A participatory research approach was used to develop, design and assess the impact of animal health messages on the control of bovine trypanosomiasis for smallholder farmers in tsetse and trypanosomiasis endemic areas in Busia (two administrative divisions) and Kwale Districts (two administrative divisions) of Kenya. Communication intervention materials (in poster and leaflet formats) were developed and disseminated to residents in villages in one administrative division in each district (intervention area) while those from the other division in each district were not deliberately exposed to the animal health messages (control area). Several communication impact indicators were derived and these were measured 4-6 weeks after dissemination of the print media through questionnaires oil trypanosomiasis knowledge administered to school children and cattle-keeping smallholders in the intervention and control study sites. School children's post-communication intervention trypanosomiasis signs knowledge was much higher than that observed during the pre-communication intervention survey. More trypanocides were named by school children during the post-intervention questionnaire survey compared to those known during the pre-intervention survey. The trypanosomiasis signs knowledge score obtained by the smallholder farmers exposed to the extension materials was higher than that obtained by those not exposed to them. Similarly, farmers' exposure to extension materials resulted in higher trypanocidal drug knowledge scores among exposed farmers than among those not exposed. These results indicate that over the period monitored, the routes (i.e. school children, village elders, animal health centres and Agrovet shops) and media (posters and leaflets) selected were effective in promoting a significant increase in knowledge of trypanosomiasis, its causes and ways of dealing with it among livestock keepers.

Participatory processes have been institutionalized in public extension and have brought new meaning to both extension and understanding rural development. The interactive engagement of smallholder farmers by public extension and the conducive environment created by the approach for other service providers to interact with communities has brought many advantages. The participation of women and youth, the poor and vulnerable groups in generating information and solutions to address food security and other rural needs has been impressive. The knowledge gained from the interaction has contributed in influencing policy change and research priorities. Smallholder farmers have formed common interest groups, which has enabled them to move from subsistence to business farming associated with increased knowledge, increased productivity and increased demand for produce. The approach has enabled extension service providers to reach more farmers per year than they did previously. The partnerships created between public extension with other institutions contributed to enhancement of knowledge and skills that has enabled the approach to spread to more areas in the country. Further capacity development among the extension providers and formulation of supportive policies that encourage demand-driven extension will lead to further improvement of the approach and scaling up.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Mekong Delta's shrimp farming contributes to socio-economic development but tends to reduce the mangrove area. On the one hand, NGOs advocate balancing ecology and economy, while on the other hand, the Vietnamese government supports intensifying shrimp production. The latter strategy increases shrimp diseases and marginalises smallholders. To influence the opinions, knowledge and behaviour of shrimp farmers, we developed and tested a serious board game.Approach: Through several iterations, we designed a realistic board game mimicking local shrimp farming. Then, after conducting three sessions of gameplay with farmers in three sites, we assessed how this gameplay influenced players. We used a semi-experimental set-up by collecting data on the day of the gameplay, and on two further time-points.Findings: After the gameplays, farmers reported to have learned about the risks of monoculture-intensive-shrimp system and the advantages of hybrid systems. Likert ratings showed that players adopted innovations faster and, in case of shrimp diseases, consulted commercial service-providers less, but with other farmers more. They confirmed to have learned that the best strategy for them would be to adopt hybrid systems, i.e. intensify part of the area of mixed-mangrove or improved-extensive shrimp farms.Theoretical implications: Realistic board games can create opportunities for social learning and training of groups which are not always easy to reach.Practical implications: Board games can support transfer of knowledge and skills to farmers, and can develop their critical thinking.Creation: The findings that board games are effective in the context of a top-down extension systems offer value opportunities.},

An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80\%) and high gains (50.20\%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers' improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State.},

The EAU4Food project, aimed at increasing food production in irrigation schemes in Africa through improved farming strategies, used a platform design inspired by the community of practice (CoP) concept, which opened up space for farmers' interactive learning and enabled their active participation in the innovation process. In this article we present examples of how this approach has been implemented in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Tunisia. We analyse the level of farmers' participation that was achieved at different stages of the implementation process, namely: deciding how to set up the CoP, identifying innovation needs and conducting the experiment. Among different strategies deployed by EAU4Food researchers, working with dialogue groups, engaging farmers in data interpretation and passing the responsibility over elements of the research process to farmers, proved to be the most effective in strengthening farmers' involvement. The use of a simulation game to test innovations also showed promising results and should be explored further. The attitude of researchers proved to be an important factor in achieving a high level of farmers' engagement in the project. Copyright (c) 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Factor analysis of survey data from 44 smallholders identified three factors-related to farm size, farmer's engagement, and household structure-that explained 70 \% of cumulative variance. The subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis yielded three clusters. Cluster 1 included the most senior farmers with fewest years of education but greatest years of experience. Cluster 2 included farmers who reported access to extension, cooperative services, and more management changes. Cluster 2 obtained 25 and 35 \% more milk than farmers in clusters 1 and 3, respectively. Cluster 3 included the youngest farmers, with most years of education and greatest availability of family labor. Access to a network and membership in a community of peers appeared as important contributors to success. Smallholders gravitated towards easy to implement technologies that have immediate benefits. Nonusers of high investment technologies found them unaffordable because of cost, insufficient farm size, and lack of knowledge or reliable electricity. Multivariate analysis may be a useful tool in planning extension activities and organizing channels of communication to effectively target farmers with varying needs, constraints, and motivations for change and in identifying farmers who may exemplify models of change for others who manage farms that are structurally similar but performing at a lower level.},

	doi = {10.4102/sajim.v18i1.679},
	abstract = {Background: Access to agricultural knowledge is important in transforming livelihoods of those relying on agriculture for a living and in enhancing food security. This access to agricultural knowledge is influenced by infrastructure needed for information dissemination. However, information infrastructure is not uniformly distributed within and between countries. It is because of this that some of the farming communities are information rich while others are information poor. In Tanzania, the agricultural sector is characterised by poor research-extension-farmers linkage and inaccessibility of agricultural knowledge at farm level Objective: The study investigated the factors influencing access to agricultural knowledge among smallholder rice farmers in the Kilombero district of Tanzania. Specifically, the study identified categories of agricultural knowledge needed by farmers, determined how farmers access agricultural knowledge, and assessed the factors limiting the accessibility of agricultural knowledge among rice farmers in the Kilombero district. Method: Quantitative data were collected via semi-structured questionnaires administered face-to-face with rice farmers, community leaders, and agricultural agents in four villages at the Kilombero district of the Morogoro region in Tanzania. Results: The key finding indicates that farmers accessed and used agricultural knowledge in undertaking agricultural activities. It was further revealed that the level of acquisition of agricultural knowledge increased with an increase in age. Farmers needed agricultural knowledge on land preparation, seed selection, and rice planting, while few acquired knowledge on agricultural markets. Among the agricultural knowledge sources used, demonstration plots and agricultural extension agents were found to be used by the majority of the farmers. It was also found that a limited number of demonstration plots, late delivery of information services, a limited number of agricultural extension agents, and poor information and communication technologies infrastructure hindered access to agricultural knowledge among rice farmers in the district. Conclusion: A strong public-private partnership is needed to enhance access to agricultural knowledge in rural areas. In this regard, the government should set up policies and strategies that motivate private sector investment and involvement in provision of agricultural knowledge in rural areas. The private sector should extend their agricultural-related activities to most rural areas so that more people can have access to agricultural knowledge.},

	abstract = {Maize production is of critical importance to smallholder farmers in Ghana. Various factors limit the productivity of smallholder maize farming systems undergirded by the lack of capital for critical investments both at the farm and at national policy levels. Using a value chain approach, this diagnostic study explains how a complex configuration of actor interaction within an institutionally and agro-ecologically challenged value chain leads to the enduring absence of maize farming credit support. We find a cycle of credit rationing resulting from value chain challenges such as agro-ecological uncertainties, inadequate GAPs training, weak farmer groups and market insecurity. This condition is sustained by an interplay between mistrust, insufficient information across the value chain and inadequate control strategies in the maize credit system. We argue that Digital Platforms (DPs) show potential to help overcome some information and communication gaps and related uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangements. This is promising in terms of aiding awareness and coordinated responsiveness to agro-ecological farm conditions and the development of farming records databases. Thus, DPs could generate new networks and forms of cooperation in the maize value chain in this regard. As a tool for mediating trust in value chain credit cooperation, strategic use of these DP contributions could help initiate an entry point for recalibration of trust perceptions. Significant considerations and improvements are however needed to harness DPs effectively in mediating trust for maize credit provision, not least being farmer digital inclusion in DP implementation, effective intermediation and network governance arrangements and digital contributions towards cost-effective agro-ecological controls in the erratic maize farming context. This approach to trust building should therefore not be viewed as a quick fix but as a process of trial and error, and learning by doing.},

This research, conducted in 2016, sought to determine whether private extension providers are more effective than public extension as information sources for smallholder farmers. The specific objectives were to examine the effectiveness of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) use by public and private agricultural extension providers and to analyze statistically, the performances of public and private extension systems. A sample of 342 farmers drawn from a list of 2,365 rice growers registered with public and private offices in Gujranwala, the largest rice-producing district in Pakistan, were interviewed. The study found that extension agents in the private sector were less effective than the public sector, in communicating development messages to resource-poor farmers.

	abstract = {Globally, forest ecosystems are shrinking and their health is declining due to a range of biotic and abiotic factors. Forest ecosystems in Pakistan are no exception and the country faces a crisis as its growing population ({\textgreater} 208 million) places increasing pressure on the country's food production systems and forest resources. Effective food systems that enhance productivity, increase economic outputs, improve ecological outcomes and maintain social acceptance are needed. Agroforestry, a traditional land management system in Pakistan, offers the opportunity to meet these goals. Planting trees on private farmland provides clear ownership of any timber resource and well managed systems have great potential both to boost agriculture and reduce wood shortages. Concerted extension efforts have been made to introduce and promote innovative agroforestry practices in Pakistan, but the success of these efforts depends on many factors. This paper reviews some of the current constraints to agroforestry promotion in Pakistan, including attitudes of the extension staff, poor or weak research-extension coordination, lack of trained personnel, lack of farmer response to advice, tree species limitations, and market mechanism as well as wood price challenges. Establishing model agroforestry farms at the village level can be a productive extension approach, but successful extension programming requires partners to share both an appreciation of the problem and a vision of successful outcomes. Successful promotion also requires appropriate choice of message, messenger, target audience and effective use of appropriate communication tools. Remedial measures to streamline the existing systems and devise future sustainable strategies and approaches are suggested to promote agroforestry in Pakistan.},

Although these changes suggest new opportunities for smallholders, too little is known about how changes will ultimately improve the wellbeing of smallholders in Ethiopia. Thus, we examine whether these changes are improving the ability of smallholders to innovate and thus improve their own welfare. In doing so, we analyze interactions between smallholders and other actors to provide new perspectives on the role played by smallholder innovation networks in the agricultural sector by drawing on data from community case studies conducted in 10 localities. Findings suggest that public extension and administration exert a strong influence over smallholder networks, potentially crowding out market-based and civil society actors, and thus limiting beneficial innovation processes. From a policy perspective, the findings suggest the need to further explore policies and programs that create more space for market and civil society to participate in smallholder innovation networks and improve welfare. From a conceptual and methodological perspective, our findings suggest the need to incorporate rigorous applications of social network analysis into the application of innovation systems theory.},

One reason for the limited use is that the tools do not account for the complexity of heterogeneous smallholder farming systems. Identifying farm typologies has facilitated technology transfer to target groups of farmers. Accounting for heterogeneity in farm systems can help in designing and deploying DSTs to address farmer needs. Typology analysis was applied to a 600-household survey dataset to identify different farm system types. Qualitative participatory research was used to assess the potential deployment of DSTs for fertilizer management. Six types of farm systems were identified with distinct characteristics in the study area of central Myanmar. Participatory research through focus group discussions with 34 participants from the six different farm types validated the farm typologies and found that farmers from one type considered that DSTs could be useful in gaining more information and knowledge. An important finding was that DSTs providing prescriptive advice were inconsistent with what many farmers want. Farmers indicated that discussion groups are a preferred learning-based approach rather than a prescriptive tool. Farmers preferred video clips and infographics integrated into existing familiar digital platforms. This study identifies heterogeneity within a large farm sample and develops a deeper understanding of fertilizer decisions as well as knowledge and intentions related to the use of DSTs or apps via follow-up focus group discussions. Incorporating a participatory research framework with typology identification can have a beneficial role in direct interactions with smallholders that may increase their acceptability of DSTs. This study has generated valuable information about farmer types and serves as a starting point for developing a framework for discussion support systems that may better relate to the needs of farmers.},

As access to proven agricultural information is crucial to farmers, this study examined how Community Radio Broadcast (CRB) could be used to complement agricultural extension service delivery in South Africa targeting smallholder farmers. A total of 167 community radio stations (CRS) with usable data were analysed from South Africa. Based on programming format, language of communication used, listenership and target audience by CRS, a questionnaire was prepared for station managers. All public domain CRS websites were accessed to analyse the programming. The results indicated that amongst the sampled CRS, local languages are popular for programme presentations with English being used by more than 50\% of the CRS. The target audience was varied and diversified; however, only 2.85\% out of nine provinces are targeting farmers. Listenership distribution is large, cutting across different age groups with an average listenership of 964 000/province/day. However, the number of agricultural programmes aired on South African CRS is very limited. In an attempt to use CRB as an avenue for reaching the smallholder farmers, the study suggests an Agricultural Radio Information System (ARIS) model as a strategy to complement agricultural extension advisory services of South Africa.},

(ii) what is the impact of the campaign on the adoption of legume-based sustainable agricultural intensification practices and technologies?; (iii) does exposure to multiple ICT-enabled channels result in larger gains (in terms of knowledge and adoption) than exposure to only one channel? (iv) is it more cost-effective to use radio or SMS alone or use them in combination? The results show that both awareness and adoption are boosted if SMS supports radio campaigns. However, radio alone is the most cost-effective approach. Each dollar spent on the radio campaign results in 2.1 farmers that have adopted at least one new practice, compared with 0.5 farmers for SMS and 0.4 farmers for radio and SMS combined. Other factors were also important in facilitating uptake of legume-based SAI practices, such as gender, age, education and land size, but were not statistically significant when rated against the communication channels used.},

The traditional husbandry practices of smallholders largely exclude preventive health measures, increasing risks of disease transmission. Although significant efforts have been made to understand the social aspects of change development in agricultural production, attention to improving the adoption of biosecurity has been limited. This study reviews smallholder biosecurity risk factors identified in the peer-reviewed literature and from field research observations conducted in Cambodia and Laos during 2006-2013, considering these in the context of a change management perspective aimed at improving adoption of biosecurity measures. Motivation for change, resistance to change, knowledge management, cultural dimensions, systems theory and leadership are discussed. Due to geographical, physical and resource variability, the implementation of biosecurity interventions suitable for smallholders is not a one size fits all'. Smallholders should be educated in biosecurity principles and empowered to make personal decisions rather than adopt prescribed pre-defined interventions. Biosecurity interventions should be aligned with smallholder farmer motivations, preferably offering clear short-term risk management benefits that elicit interest from smallholders. Linking biosecurity and disease control with improved livestock productivity provides opportunities for sustainable improvements in livelihoods. Participatory research and extension that improves farmer knowledge and practices offers a pathway to elicit sustainable broad-scale social change. However, examples of successes need to be communicated both at the evidence-based level' to influence regional policy development and at the village or commune level, with champion farmers' and cross-visits' used to lead local change. The adoption of applied change management principles to improving regional biosecurity may assist current efforts to control and eradicate transboundary diseases in the Mekong region.},

	abstract = {Improving soil health is necessary for increasing agricultural productivity and providing multiple ecosystem services. In the African Highlands (AH) where conversion of forests to cultivation on steep slopes is leading to soil degradation, sustainable land management practices are vital. Farmers' awareness of soil health indicators (SHI) influences their choice of land management and needs to be better understood to improve communication between land managers and other stakeholders in agricultural systems. This study aims to collate and evaluate case study analyses of farmers' awareness and use of soil health indicators in African Highlands. This is achieved by using a multi-method approach that combines a meta-summary analysis of AH's SHI data from 24 published studies together with farmer interviews in the East Usambara Mountain region of Tanzania (EUM). Our findings show that farmers across the AH use observable attributes of the landscape as SHI. Out of 16 SHI reported by the farmers, vegetation performance/crop yield and soil colour were most frequently used across the AH. These were also the only two SHI that influenced farmers' land management decisions in the EUM, where organic manure addition was the only land management option resulting from observed changes in SHI. Farmers' use of only one or two SHI in land management decisions, as is the case in the EUM, seems to limit their choice and/or adoption of sustainable land management options, highlighting the need to increase awareness and use of more relevant SHI. This could be achieved by sharing SHI knowledge through learning alliances and agricultural extension service. Integration of farmers' observation techniques and conventional soil testing in a hybrid approach is recommended for a more targeted assessment of soil health to inform appropriate and sustainable land management practices.},

	abstract = {In Africa, many governments and development agencies have promoted aquaculture as a panacea for household food security, rural development, and poverty reduction. However, aquaculture production in the continent remains low despite significant investments in research and technology development. While numerous initiatives have been directed at technological innovation and transfer, their present scale of uptake is very slow and therefore inadequate to achieve transformational change envisaged in the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. In this paper, we aim to (1) critically analyze the factors that influence fish farmer's perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward technology adoption; and (2) to determine the impacts of technology adoption on farmer's livelihoods. Primary data were collected using a self-administered digitized questionnaire to 331 randomly selected farmers in Kenya. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze data. Results revealed that variables including secondary education, diversified on-farm activities, farm size, production levels, attendance of extension training, ease of understanding, and ease of handling technologies were positive and significant predictors of aquaculture technology adoption. However, 30\% of fish farmers were categorized as high adopters of novel aquaculture technologies, implying that there are gaps in technical skills hindering adoption of innovative technologies and best management practices. To facilitate learning and uptake of technologies and good practices by farmers, a range of aquaculture-related extension and communication materials, including posters, hard copy information leaflets and brochures of recipes in appropriate languages, short video presentations, and radio features, should be commissioned to support the smallholder farmers.},

Kenyan farmers are faced with limited public agricultural extension services, narrowing their sources of useful information including adaptive strategies that would help them cope with the impacts of climate change. Radio can be an effective extension tool with the ability to reach many farmers in their local language. This study investigated the potential of radio in influencing the utilization of climate change information by farmers in Kilifi County, located along the Kenyan coast. Education and communication about climate change was undertaken using radio to make available and understandable information to different social and cultural groups. This study revealed that radio can effectively complement other agricultural extension methods and has the potential to engage farmers on climate change issues and motivate them to take action, if appropriate approaches are used. Although very few of the farmers surveyed (33\%) reported to have listened to the programs, a high percentage (82\%) of those who did implemented the recommended strategies and technologies they heard. The major challenges reported by farmers to accessing the radio programs were lack of a radio and unsuitable program timing. An additional reported challenge was the inability to store or record the programs resulting in farmers relying on their own recollection when implementing strategies. Further research should explore the use of social learning approaches that encourage group rather than individual listenership (such as community listening clubs and community-based radio schools) to overcome these challenges.},

	abstract = {Defining an agenda is critical to a research process, and a transdisciplinary approach is expected to improve relevance of an agenda and resultant research outputs. Given the complexity of farming systems, farmer differences and the involvement of different stakeholders, as well as the expectations of research funders, what contributions can be made by different interest groups to the construction of an actionable research agenda that produces locally relevant yet original, empirical and transferable findings? In a case study of smallholder irrigation in South Africa, we analyze how, using a transdisciplinary approach, a balance can be struck between the priorities of different stakeholders in defining a research agenda. A transdisciplinary approach was interpreted to entail full participation of diverse stakeholders and integration of different issues as key features. Stakeholder participation was mediated through formal platforms: the Learning and Practice Alliance (LPA) and the Community of Practice (CoP). Farmers and local extension workers participated through the CoP, while other stakeholders, including the public and private sector participated through the LPA. A five step participatory process aimed at allowing stakeholders to fully understand issues, contribute to and validate the research agenda was followed, utilizing a combination of methods, including field observation, photography and discussion. We observed that farmer and researcher participation occurred along two main continua, which we define as a `participation matrix' - one continuum relating to the contribution of knowledge and information, and the other to decision making. The participation matrix can be used as a reference framework for guiding the transdisciplinary definition of research agendas, to aid in balancing knowledge and priorities including local relevance, ownership, originality, and transferability of findings. We argue that the transdisciplinary process, mediated through structured stakeholder participation, open dialogue and continual validation by all stakeholders was time and resource intensive, but enabled each stakeholder group to contribute to the process distinctly, resulting in a research agenda that integrated different needs and expectations.

The research approaches taken by these systems explicitly or implicitly seek simple, one-size-fits-all solutions for problems and opportunities that are extremely diverse. Radical change is needed to facilitate the agroecological intensification of smallholder farming. We propose that large-scale participatory approaches, combined with innovations in information and communications technology (ICT), could enable the effective matching of diverse options to the wide spectrum of socio-ecological context that characterize smallholder agriculture. We consider the requirements, precedents and issues that might be involved in the development of farmer research networks (FRNs). Substantial institutional innovation will be needed to support FRNs, with shifts in roles and relationships amongst researchers, extension providers and farmers. Where farmers' organizations have social capital and strong facilitation skills, such alignments may be most feasible. Novel information management capabilities will be required to introduce options and principles, enable characterization of contexts, manage data related to option-by-context interactions and enable farmers to visualize their findings in useful and intelligible ways. FRNs could lead to vastly greater capacity for technical innovation, which could in turn enable greater productivity and resilience, and enhance the quality of rural life.},

The project explored the livelihood strategies of coffee growers in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica facing multiple stressors of economic (market shocks and price volatility) and physical nature (climate variability and pest incidence). Our objective was to determine the factors that influence farmers' decisions and the implications of those decisions for the people and the landscapes of the region. To achieve this objective, we intended to engage farm communities and sector representatives in the research process, and to a large extent this intent was realized. Nevertheless, the project illustrates the difficulties in achieving knowledge “co-production” with stakeholders whose day-to-day existence focuses on issues largely outside the domain of the research program. We adopted decision-analysis tools to integrate our knowledge and hypotheses to find a common language and structure for our research design. In relation to regional and national policy makers and sector experts, we aimed to communicate the decision-environment of the smallholder producer to enhance awareness of the institutional opportunities and constraints in the adaptation process. For the farmers themselves, we aimed to serve as conduits and mirrors of their own knowledge, rather than serving as external authorities on issues that appeared to be of little interest to them. Through the course of the project, we experimented with diverse modes of stakeholder interaction and, through collaboration with local experts in communication strategies, identified a set of tools for successful dissemination of results. The credibility and direct ties of the participating research organizations and collaborating institutes with the local communities were often an asset, sometimes a complication, but always a critical factor in the process of stakeholder interaction. The messages constructed from the collective knowledge of local farmer's in distinct regions in four countries with different social and institutional histories represent crucial information for policy makers who are looking to support the adaptation processes of rural people facing changes of a global nature. However, communicating these messages in a usable and useful way to decision makers at various levels proved to be challenging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Parasitic weeds such as Striga spp and Rhamphicarpa fistulosa in smallholder rice production systems form an increasing problem for food and income security in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper we implement the Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS) as a diagnostic tool to identify specific and generic entry points for innovations to address parasitic weeds in rain-fed rice production in Tanzania. Data were gathered across three study sites in Tanzania where parasitic weeds are eminent (Kyela, Songea Rural and Morogoro Rural districts). The results demonstrate that in Tanzania, weeds in general and parasitic weeds in particular receive little attention in agricultural research, training and education curricula. Crop protection policies mainly focus on the control of (insect) pest and diseases and there is relatively little attention for weed prevention, which is essential for addressing parasitic weed problems effectively. Specific entry points for innovation include increasing awareness of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers and policymakers. In regions where awareness is relatively high, participatory research approaches can provide a basis for developing locally adapted parasitic weed management strategies. Generic entry points for innovation include enhanced collaboration and interaction between stakeholders across different levels, for example in multi-stakeholder platforms. This can provide the basis for developing and implementing coherent policy and development strategies to address structural constraints in the agricultural system, including the promotion of clean local seed systems, investments in physical and knowledge infrastructure development, adequate backstopping of agricultural extension officers, agribusiness training for farmers, quality control of agricultural inputs, timely access to agricultural inputs, and improved access to markets for farmers. Together the specific and generic entry points can strengthen the innovation capacity of Tanzania's agricultural system to address parasitic weed problems, as well as other complex agricultural problems.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Study tools and methods were questionnaire survey (N = 200), focus group discussion (N = 1), in-depth interviews (N = 18) and field direct observation. Findings: This study shows there existed diversity of information resources in Hohoe. This diversity was, however, devoid of a broad integration process to enhance smallholder access to and use of agricultural information. We demonstrate that new information channels or sources cannot function independently, but rather through an integrated approach that relies on a human facet of extension. Practical Implications: We illustrate the need for integrated extension that includes interactive field modules such as basic cell phone decision guides that support smallholder construction of solutions for their circumstances. This process requires new sets of smallholder skills and holistic extension schemes that diversify information resources through incorporation and adaptation, rather than substitution. New information resources can only be gradually mainstreamed through integration with more familiar extension means. They need a human interface because smallholder householders did not require same types and/or amounts of information. Human interface is essential to ensure critical groups including women access and utilise agricultural information resources, but without entrenching unfair task allocations among smallholder householders. Originality/Value: This paper illustrates how extension can be strengthened through new approaches. However, new approaches such as use of basic cell phones cannot be standalone processes; they require a human interface and an integrated process.

An evolving approach, emerging from participatory research experiences, involves community-based breeding programs for smallholder farmers in low-input systems. These are being implemented in pilot research sites with promising results and already rendering lessons learned that merit consideration in relation with the sustainability of a program. The paper discusses important factors for the success of these programs. Farmers' participation along with main issues for program implementation are highlighted in relation to site selection, the communication processes, recording schemes, role of scientists, the institutionalisation of cooperation and the enabling environment. Finally, ongoing case studies of successful community-based breeding programs are mentioned. Shortcomings in farmers' participation require attention and institutional strengthening for effective application of participatory tools and knowledge exchange between farmers and researchers. But participatory research alone is not the sole prescription for success. No matter how participatory the plans will be, they will always depend on technical support and institutional support for data collection, analysis and feedback. This is hindered because of the short-term projection of funding for research projects. An important issue relates to the out scaling of successful experiences at project level that benefits only a limited number of farmers. The only avenue to guarantee sustainability is that government priorities (local or national) emphasize community-based breeding as a viable alternative for smallholder improvement on a long-term basis, and development and appropriate policies provide the enabling environment for realization and adoption at a large scale. Under these conditions research will have an advisory and facilitating role whereas ownership of the program will go to the community-level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A case study of the intention of Indonesian coffee farmers to use a tree canopy trimming technique in pine-based agroforestry highlights path-dependency and complexity of social-ecological relationships. Farmers have contracts permitting coffee cultivation under pine trees owned by the state forestry company but have no right to fell trees. A multidisciplinary international team of scientists supported farmers at the University of Brawijaya Forest in East Java to trial canopy trimming to improve light for coffee production while maintaining tree density. Data were collected using surveys through interviews, case study analysis using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and nonparticipant observations. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, we found that though farmer attitudes toward trimming techniques were positive, several factors needed to be scrutinized: perceived limited socio-policy support and resources. While there is hope that canopy trimming can improve coffee production and local ecosystem services, a participatory and integrative extension and communication strategy will be needed. In the relationship between farmers as agents and forest authorities as principals, any agroforestry innovation needs to incorporate knowledge and concerns in the triangle of farmers, policymakers and empirical science.},

	abstract = {This article is a commentary on several research studies conducted on the prospects for aerobic rice production systems that aim at reducing the demand for irrigation water which in certain major rice producing areas of the world is becoming increasingly scarce. The research studies considered, as reported in published articles mainly under the aegis of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), have a narrow scope in that they test only 3 or 4 rice varieties under different soil moisture treatments obtained with controlled irrigation, but with other agronomic factors of production held as constant. Consequently, these studies do not permit an assessment of the interactions among agronomic factors that will be of critical significance to the performance of any production system. Varying the production factor of “water” will seriously affect also the levels of the other factors required to optimise the performance of a production system. The major weakness in the studies analysed in this article originates from not taking account of the interactions between experimental and non-experimental factors involved in the comparisons between different production systems. This applies to the experimental field design used for the research studies as well as to the subsequent statistical analyses of the results. The existence of such interactions is a serious complicating element that makes meaningful comparisons between different crop production systems difficult. Consequently, the data and conclusions drawn from such research readily become biased towards proposing standardised solutions for possible introduction to farmers through a linear technology transfer process. Yet, the variability and diversity encountered in the real-world farming environment demand more flexible solutions and approaches in the dissemination of knowledge-intensive production practices through “experiential learning” types of processes, such as those employed by farmer field schools. This article illustrates, based on expertise of the `system of rice intensification' (SRI), that several cost-effective and environment-friendly agronomic solutions to reduce the demand for irrigation water, other than the asserted need for the introduction of new cultivars, are feasible. Further, these agronomic Solutions can offer immediate benefits of reduced water requirements and increased net returns that Would be readily accessible to a wide range of rice producers, particularly the resource poor smallholders.

	abstract = {The demand for palm oil is steadily increasing where global consumption in 2020 has reached 77 million metric tons or equivalent to 7 kg of palm per capita usage. However, the industry is under critics for unsustainable production practice and environmental degradation due to unscrupulous deforestation. One of the measures taken to ensure sustainability practices in the industry in Malaysia includes certifications such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO). These certifications are offered to industry players/plantation giants in which all stakeholders/members need to fulfill stringent requirements in order to obtain the certification. Efforts are now being taken to ensure that every stakeholder in the palm oil industry obtain sustainable certification, and this includes effort to enable smallholders to also follow the guidelines and fulfill the certification requirements. However, as of 2021, only 30\% smallholders were certified despite the rigorous efforts made. Several factors may have hindered the participation of these smallholders. Hence, it is crucial that the agencies involved in managing this industry identify the factors influencing the certification of smallholders. The identification of these determinants will help policymakers to strengthen policy in disseminating sustainability practices in the palm oil industry. The objective of the current study is to identify factors influencing smallholders' participation in palm oil certification in Malaysia. This study looks beyond rational choice theory and develops a model based on elements of social structure and interaction. Quantitative approaches through questionnaire survey were used in this study. Purposive sampling was used, and data collections involved 200 oil palm smallholders in Malaysia. Four elements, namely, “Perceived Economic Benefit,” “Social Interaction,” “Shared Identity,” and “Communication Discourse,” were found to have significant influences on smallholders' participation in palm oil sustainable certification.

	abstract = {The ongoing expansion of global trade and human mobility are causing increased occurrences of biosecurity outbreaks, particularly of invasive pests which threaten biodiversity and agricultural production. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable, as they are generally not well-prepared for such incursions. In Australia, farmers with non-English speaking backgrounds are more likely to be influenced by these increasing risks and may need long-term adaptive support. Understanding farmers' perceptions of biosecurity threats, and what drives these perceptions, is a prerequisite for designing effective biosecurity management policies to support livelihoods and food security. In this study, we aim to understand the perceptions of smallholder farmers' on biosecurity threats and the factors influencing their perceptions. Data was obtained from a survey of 101 Vietnamese farmers across three geographically dispersed locations in Australia (Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia). Using the Protection Motivation Theory, we found that 43\% of farmers perceived biosecurity threats to be one of the key agricultural risks, preceded by weather-related risk (48\%) and produce price fluctuations (45\%). Belief in the existence of biosecurity threats and the sources of information on biosecurity matters had a significant positive influence on farmers' overall perceptions of biosecurity threats on four dimensions of their life. English levels had a significant influence on their perceptions of biosecurity threats on crop output whereas farm size, gender, and farmers' age did not significantly affect farmers' overall perceptions of biosecurity threats. The findings of this study could be used by government agencies and industry associations to better target support for farmers to minimise the threats of pest and disease incursions. Support could be delivered through the introduction of relevant extension services and education programs with more transparent and direct communications of risk and compliances, improving farmers' knowledge and belief in biosecurity and fostering trust between farmers and the government.},

This paper assesses farmer adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and innovation after being exposed to Farms of the Future Approach (FotF). First; we explore and assess the various CSA technologies and practices; including institutional innovations farmers are adopting. Second; we identify and document farmer learning and dissemination pathways that can enhance adoption of CSA technologies and practices. Third; we identify existing institutions that enhance adoption of CSA practices. We use household survey data, complemented by qualitative information from focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The results show farmers are adopting a variety of CSA technologies, practices, and institutional innovations to after participating in the FotF approach with use of improved crop varieties, agroforestry, and scientific weather forecast information cited as the main practices. To minimize their risks and reduce vulnerabilities, farmers are diversifying and integrating five to 10 CSA practices in one season. Matengo pits, SACCOs, and efficient energy stoves were adopted by very few farmers due to their high initial investment costs and unsuitability to the area. Ninety-eight percent of farmers reported that they receive agricultural information orally from a variety of sources including government extension workers, seed companies, researchers, traditional experts, neighbors, radio agricultural shows, religious groups, farmer groups, and family members. Lastly, farmers reported that the FotF approach is a useful tool that enabled them to interact with other farmers and learn new CSA practices and innovations. Suggested improvements to make on the FotF included include longer trip duration, increased number of farmer participants, and gender balance and age considerations to include youth.},

The levels of knowledge and awareness of the dangers to the environment and human health were investigated by questionnaires for farmers (209) and retailers (20) in two rural regions (Qianyang County (S1) and Chencang County (S2)) of the Wei River catchment in China where the modes of farming and the state of erosion are very different. The results showed that farmers learned the use and dangers of pesticides mainly by oral communication (p {\textless} 0.01). Protective measures were inadequate; 65\% (51) and 55\% (S2) of farmers never used any protective measures during spraying (p {\textless} 0.05). Washing hands ({\textgreater}70\%) was the most common mode of personal hygiene, relative to wearing masks, showering, and changing clothes, but no significant differences were observed between the selected regions. Most pesticide wastes were dumped directly onto the land or into water, suggesting that educational measures should be taken to address the potential risks from the residues in the wastes. Over 85\% of farmers (S1 and 52) claimed to use illegal pesticides, but the reasons for their use varied (p {\textless} 0.01). Retailers were well-informed and highly conscious of their responsibility for the safe use of pesticides, especially in S2 (p {\textless} 0.01). A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that educational level and age differed between the two regions and contributed greatly to the risks from pesticide use (p {\textless} 0.01). Educational programmes targeted to age groups, proper disposal of pesticide waste, and sufficient supervision from authorities should consequently be considered for improving the levels of knowledge and awareness of the dangers of pesticides to human health and environmental pollution in the Wei River catchment China.

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to comparatively assess the most suitable channels for dissemination of agricultural innovations along the entire information value chain. Design/Methodology/Approach: We calculated information scores to measure channel preference from a randomly selected sample of farmers: 285 in Tamale, Ghana and 300 in Kakamega, Kenya. Using t-tests we compared the information score differences of different channels between farmers who adopted Integrated Soil Fertility Management and those who did not. Findings: The highest information scores were observed for radio along the entire value chain for both locations. However, farmers in Tamale prefered interpersonal channels for processing information. Radio and farmer field days had the highest rankings for production information at both locations. Radio, workshops and interpersonal channels (traders and neighbours/friends/relatives) were best-bet channels for marketing and procesing information. Practical implication: Extension agents should place more emphasis on channels such as radio, farmer field days, and workshops as they may offer more efficient delivery of information packages at all levels, whilst recognizing the central role of interpersonal channels. Theoretical implication: The nexus between the uses and gratification, adoption, diffusion of innovations theories and the collaborative communication theory on one hand, and the agricultural product value chain framework on the other, is highlighted. Farmers' preference for information channels is not predicated on the stage of the value chain. Originality/Value: In the current context of weak agricultural knowledge and innovation systems in African agriculture, agricultural producers are poorly informed about the current innovations. This study furnishes empirical evidence on the best-bet information channels to be used by extension workers and change agents to disseminate and communicate system innovations.},

	abstract = {When anthropologists interviewed Honduran and Nepali smallholders in the mid-1990s, they were told that “Insects are a terrible mistake in God's creation” and “There's nothing that kills them, except for insecticides”. Even growers who maintained a close bond with nature were either entirely unaware of natural pest control, or expressed doubt about the actual value of these services on their farm. Farmers' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards pests and natural enemies are of paramount importance to the practice of biological control, but are all too often disregarded. In this study, we conduct a retrospective analysis of the extent to which social science facets have been incorporated into biological control research over the past 25 years. Next, we critically examine various biological control forms, concepts and technologies using a `diffusion of innovations' framework, and identify elements that hamper their diffusion and farm-level uptake. Lastly, we introduce effective observation-based learning strategies, such as farmer field schools to promote biological control, and list how those participatory approaches can be further enriched with information and communication technologies (ICT). Although biological control scientists have made substantial technological progress and generate nearly 1000 papers annually, only a fraction (1.4\%) of those address social science or technology transfer aspects. To ease obstacles to enhanced farmer learning about biological control, we describe ways to communicate biological control concepts and technologies for four divergent agricultural knowledge systems (as identified within a matrix built around `cultural importance' and `ease of observation'). Furthermore, we describe how biological control innovations suffer a number of notable shortcomings that hamper their farm-level adoption and subsequent diffusion, and point at ways to remediate those by tactical communication campaigns or customized, (ICT-based) adult education programs. Amongst others, we outline how video, smart phones, or tablets can be used to convey key ecological concepts and biocontrol technologies, and facilitate social learning. In today's digital era, cross-disciplinary science and deliberate multi-stakeholder engagement will provide biocontrol advocates the necessary means to bolster farmer adoption rates, counter-act surging insecticide use, and restore public trust in one of nature's prime services.},

	abstract = {Efforts to increase above- and below-ground biodiversity in farming systems require greater understanding of how farmers develop and use their knowledge of biodiversity, ecological processes and soil quality. The goal of this research was to assess the extent to which farmers have incorporated their observations of native species and ecological processes into farm management practices in a hillside agroforestry system of western Honduras. The system incorporates slash-and-mulch of native vegetation (rather than slash-and-burn cultivation, which was widely practiced in the area before 1990), and the retention of trees within cropping fields. Information on farmer knowledge was elicited primarily through semi-structured interviews with 20 farmers. Farmers interviewed distinguish several local soil types on the basis of soil texture, colour, structure and stone content, with each soil type having varying suitability for the major crops grown in the district (maize, beans, sorghum and pasture). The most highly valued tree species are those that fulfil multiple economic and agricultural functions, including having a positive influence on soil quality through decomposition, nutrient cycling, and provision of soil cover. In particular, species with small, fine leaves that gave dappled shade (rather than solid shade) and decomposed rapidly were preferred. Farmers named 16 commonly recognised, distinct soil macrofauna taxa. The most detailed knowledge on the relationship between soil fauna and soil quality was held on taxa considered to have either beneficial or harmful effects on farming activities, such as earthworms and beetle larvae. Farmers had complex understanding of the influence of fire on soils, vegetation, crop yield and soil biota over various lengths of time, which may have been gained through a combination of first-hand experience, interaction with agricultural extension workers, and information gained from other farmers. It is likely that local ecological knowledge of the effect of different species on soil quality, the interactions among species, and the role of vegetation in maintaining agricultural productivity and landscape integrity, is an important component of the adoption and success of the agroforestry system.

The experiment involved demonstration trials and field days, and improved capacity of Development Agents in facilitation and communication skills. The empirical results revealed that farmers' decisions to try the newly introduced wheat variety were highest in the villages where demonstration trials and field days, and improvements in the Development Agents' facilitation and communication capacity were introduced simultaneously. We also found a positive effect of improved extension services on yields, and the use of chemical fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides, but only the use of herbicides and pesticides were statistically significant.

	abstract = {The prevalence of tomato diseases and local smallholder farmer knowledge was assessed in five villages in the Morogoro Region of Tanzania during the rainy and dry production seasons. The most commonly occurring foliar diseases in both seasons were early blight (88 of 100 fields), bacterial spot/speck (49), viral diseases (42) and Septoria leaf spot (34). Bacterial spot/speck, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, other viral diseases, and late blight were present in significantly higher numbers of fields during the rainy season than the dry season, while significantly more plants per field were affected by early blight in the rainy season than the dry season. A root health assay was conducted to assess root knot nematode damage and root rot severity, and root knot nematodes were found in 44 of 50 fields surveyed. Farmers used local names for plant diseases, which tended to be associated with the symptomatology of the disease, concepts borrowed from other aspects of life, perceived causal agent or weather conditions. Identification of local names improved communication between farmers and researchers and elucidated how farmers perceived key diseases in the region. Extension materials were developed to improve farmers' identification and management of key tomato diseases in the region. Farmers can better allocate limited resources to manage key diseases through an improved understanding of prevalent diseases and local plant disease knowledge. This study serves as an example of how plant pathologists can develop a baseline understanding of key regional plant disease constraints through the integration of field surveys and ethnophytopathological studies.},

	abstract = {This study applied the multi-group structural equation modeling technique to identify differences in farmer motivations to adopting agroforestry practices in the Mt. Elgon region of Uganda. Data were collected from interviews with 400 smallholder coffee farmers belonging to four categories which included: (1) those actively participating in an Australian-funded trees for food security (T4FS) project from phase 1 (2014); (2) farmers neighbouring those actively participating in the T4FS project; (3) farmers actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 2 (2017) and; (4) farmers living distant and unaware of the T4FS project. We used the theory of planned behaviour framework to assess the adoption behaviour of these farmer categories resulting from project interventions. About 40\% of the variation in farmer motivation to integrate trees in their coffee plantations was explained by the significant variables of `attitude' and `perceived behavioural control' among farmers actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 1. However, the neighbors of participating farmers and farmers who had never interacted with the project were only motivated by `attitude' and `social norms' respectively. Farmer motivation resulting from social pressure was strongest among farmers who had never interacted with the project, and in the absence of project interventions, rely on existing social structures to drive change in their community. Farmers' perceived behavioural control to overcome tree planting barriers and their attitude to the economic benefits of shaded coffee were significantly different among the four farmer categories (p {\textless} 0.05). The findings indicate that psychological factors are key drivers to the farmers' internal decision-making process in agroforestry technology adoption and can be context-specific. The adoption behaviour of smallholder farmers is mainly shaped by existing community social norms and beliefs that tend to promote knowledge exchange, as opposed to the conventional knowledge transfer extension approaches. Norms are therefore an inherent part of social systems and can create distinct farming practices, habits and standards within a social group. Researchers and extension agents can act upon these identified positive attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural controls to guarantee adoption and sustainability of agricultural technologies.},

	doi = {10.1071/WR10166},
	abstract = {Context. In Asia, losses to rodents contribute to the undernourishment of smallholder families. Ecologically based rodent management (EBRM) has become the national policy for rodent management in rice-based agriculture in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. EBRM requires community action. Therefore we need to develop communication campaigns that increase community involvement in rodent management. Aims. This study evaluates the effects of a campaign to promote EBRM in a community that suffers chronic rodent losses to their rice crop. We hypothesised that the campaign would create changes in rodent management by farmers based on key messages delivered. Methods. We documented existing beliefs and management practices, and captured changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of smallholder farmers after the campaign. We also document benefits to the community. We used qualitative tools to evaluate existing beliefs and management practices of rodents in nine villages in Zaragosa, one of which was a focus village for the campaign. Key results. Farmers who were influenced by the campaign had significantly higher mean rank scores in knowledge and attitudes pertaining to key messages of the campaign, such as working together, proper timing of management actions, and that rodents can be controlled. Farmers who heard the campaign obtained yields that were higher by 0.7 t ha(-1) compared with those with no exposure to the campaign. Ayear after the campaign, the increase in rice yield in Zaragosa was sufficient to feed 1375 adult Filipinos for a year. The campaign influenced policy on rodent management in Zaragosa and subsequently at the provincial level. Conclusions. A media campaign with support from local leaders and extension staff is an effective way to disseminate EBRM, leading to positive economic benefits for smallholder farmers. A media campaign alone is less effective. Implications. A communication campaign on EBRM with follow-up support from extension experts is a highly effective pathway for changing attitudes and practices of smallholder farmers on rodent management, and for effective dissemination of EBRM.},

Results show that high rates of agricultural innovation occurred during displacement in the Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005), many of which were maintained afterwards. Respondents cited the need for adaptation to new social and physical circumstances, changed gender roles, and enhanced inter-household communication as contributing to increased opportunities for knowledge exchange, trade, and importantly, the development of new networks, modes of organisation and social norms. Furthermore, returnees to South Sudan have embodied these changes together with new values, habits and expectations. New linkages continued across borders between returnees and non-returnees, facilitating knowledge exchange and access to resources, markets and sources of ideas. A high degree of autonomous innovation capacity was also evident. Further research is required on the dynamics and processes associated with innovation in conflict-induced displacement. It is important for policy makers to encourage approaches that seek to actively tap into and build on the institutional, human and social capital built during displacement.},

Overall, the study finds that interactive ICT tools and platforms are valuable in their capacity to improve the quality of agricultural extension and climate information services and, as such, can help smallholder farmers better manage predicted risks on the farm and elsewhere in the agriculture sector. The scope of impact in most of these projects, however, was largely premised on the numbers of beneficiaries reached (e.g., with information pertaining to an innovation). The efficacy of scaled-up results to achieve positive, long-lasting livelihood impacts in smallholder agriculture is more complex, and often requires effecting systemwide change on multiple dimensions, e.g., in societal values, institutional arrangements, market relations, and policy decision making. The scaling process here requires long-term attention, even if the impacts are not immediately apparent.},

Current approaches to geographic information dissemination to smallholders, such as the rural extension model, are limited, yet advancements in internet and communication technologies (ICTs) could help augment these processes through the provision of agricultural geographic information (AGI) directly to farmers. We analysed recent ICT initiatives for communicating climate and agriculture-related information to smallholders for improved livelihoods and climate change adaptation. Through the critical analysis of initiatives, we identified opportunities for the success of future AGI developments. We systematically examined 27 AGI initiatives reported in academic and grey literature (e.g., organisational databases). Important factors identified for the success of initiatives include affordability, language(s), community partnerships, user collaboration, high quality and locally-relevant information through low-tech platforms, organisational trust, clear business models, and adaptability. We propose initiatives should be better-targeted to deliver AGI to regions in most need of climate adaptation assistance, including SE Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Further assessment of the most effective technological approaches is needed. Initiatives should be independently assessed for evaluation of their uptake and success, and local communities should be better-incorporated into the development of AGI initiatives.},

	abstract = {The development and utility of genetically modified (GM) crops for smallholders around the world is controversial. Critical questions include what traits and crops are to be developed; how they can be adapted to smallholders' ecological, social and economic contexts; which dissemination channels should be used to reach smallholders; and which policy environments will enable the greatest benefits for smallholders and the rural poor. A key question is how the voices of smallholders who have experience with or desire to use GM technologies enter the larger debate. Africa has the greatest number of smallholders and poor with the least exposure to GM crops. Because of the well-established use of GM crops in South Africa by commercial farmers, we formed a community of practice (CoP) involving smallholders, extension, researchers, non-profits and agribusiness in KwaZulu-Natal to examine the conditions under which GM crops are used by smallholders, how smallholders interact with GM technologies and what insights smallholders and other stakeholders can provide regarding these questions. One of the advantages of the CoP approach is that it brings stakeholders together in a non-hierarchical way that encourages new ways of thinking and new partnerships. Such interaction around a specific project can enhance the voice of smallholders in a variety of ways. In our project, smallholder participants have increased their knowledge and can make better decisions about GM technologies, which had been barriers for them. Notably, they have also improved their knowledge of maize production practices, accessed new practice networks, and met new researchers and resource providers. They are now being integrated into these networks in a way that should improve their livelihoods and make the wants and needs of smallholders better known. Such knowledge and experience has improved their voice in agriculture and rural development discussions.},

	volume = {10},
	issn = {1712-8277},
	abstract = {Since around 1990, Indonesia had been importing about 40\% of its entire beef consumption. To reduce its reliance on imports, Indonesia launched the beef self-sufficiency programme (BSSP), which operated between 2005 and 2014, with the aim being to reduce imports of beef cattle to 10\% of national demand by 2014. This was particularly challenging at the time because the demand for beef had continuously increased for a number of years. The aim of this case study was to investigate how Indonesian smallholder farmers perceived their own beef-cattle production in line with the BSSP, with a particular focus on the way in which the programme was implemented. The present study is based on the findings from 14 semi-structured qualitative interviews carried out with smallholder beef-cattle farmers from the Central Java Province in Indonesia. A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data, using the software program Transana. The study showed that the farmers were mostly unaware of the existing government policies on beef-cattle farming, i.e., regarding the BSSP, including the overall aim of these policies. Furthermore, the activities they did know about they viewed as individual activities run in isolation, rather than parts of a grander plan or overall larger targeted programme-note, in this paper, we refer to these individual activities as `fragments'. The farmers who took part in the interviews outlined the challenges they faced in increasing the quantity and quality of their beef cattle. The participating farmers also outlined their experiences of how elements of the BSSP were presented to them and how these initiatives were taken up (by themselves, colleagues, or in the local community). The results of the present study show that the farmers were mostly not aware of the overarching policies like BSSP, and hence there is a clear need for the government, i.e., via the Livestock and Fishery Office, to improve how it disseminates knowledge and information about its policy programmes, particularly to the players most affected by those policies. We identified a clear need for the relevant government institutions to take the initiative and work more closely with the main players, in this case the beef-cattle farmers. Involving the farmers is considered crucial in order to create and maintain sustainable beef production. Considering the farmers' perspectives of how extension agents approach the practical implementation of governmental agricultural policy programme, such as the BSSP, we furthermore suggest that more transparent communication is needed, together with the closer involvement of farmers in all stages of the programme, i.e., not just in implementation, but also in the design and planning stages, as well as in the post-programme evaluation, in order to learn effective lessons to improve future programme delivery.},

Our article integrates relevant research concepts in a case study of the agroecological landscape knowledge of 52 participating farmers. Participatory sketch maps, transect walks, and semi-structured interviews were used to identify key areas of farmers' agroecological landscape knowledge in crop and seed management. Results indicate the prevalence of nine themes of farmer agroecological landscape knowledge. This landscape knowledge exerts major influence on the choice, placement, and management of common bean varieties and associated land use decisions. Our analysis reveals that farmers use this knowledge to manage their landholdings as landscapes of agroecological interactions that guide seed and variety management and affect potential sustainability. Results demonstrate that local agroecological landscape learning is strengthened through and benefits participatory seed projects.},

	abstract = {Manure has been used as a fertilizer since ancient times and if well-managed it can be an asset, promoting sustainable agriculture, and increasing crop production, particularly for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, most farmers in SSA do not apply recommended manure management practices, such as roofing animal housing, having a water-proof floor or covering manure during storage, causing large nutrient losses during manure storage, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing the quality of the manure as a fertilizer. This paper compares manure management practices in representative SSA countries, and summarizes government policies and socio-cultural practices that influence the adoption of good (recommended) manure management practices. Three steps were applied in this analysis: (i) review of manure management practices from various literature sources, (ii) interviews on manure management practices and policies with key stakeholders from 13 SSA countries, and (iii) surveys of manure management practices on small, medium, and large scale farms in Ethiopia and Malawi. The review confirms the potential of manure to improve crop yields and promote sustainable agriculture in SSA. Unfortunately, most SSA countries (a) do not explicitly mention manure management in their policies (b) have different ministries that share responsibilities on manure management, often leading to incoherent policies and abnegation of these responsibilities (c) take limited action to promote good practices or enforce legislation on manure management. Also, the field survey indicated that farmers lack knowledge on manure management. However, farmers are able to access agricultural extension services from both government and non-government agencies, although these extension services rarely included information on improved manure management practices. Extension services that encourage exchange and interaction between farmers were most successful in increasing adoption of good-manure management practices, and are recommended. In addition, efforts to improve manure management in SSA should strengthen the enforcement of existing policies and provide an enabling environment for adoption of good manure management practices.},

	abstract = {Wheat rust diseases pose one of the greatest threats to global food security, including subsistence farmers in Ethiopia. The fungal spores transmitting wheat rust are dispersed by wind and can remain infectious after dispersal over long distances. The emergence of new strains of wheat rust has exacerbated the risks of severe crop loss. We describe the construction and deployment of a near real-time early warning system (EWS) for two major wind-dispersed diseases of wheat crops in Ethiopia that combines existing environmental research infrastructures, newly developed tools and scientific expertise across multiple organisations in Ethiopia and the UK. The EWS encompasses a sophisticated framework that integrates field and mobile phone surveillance data, spore dispersal and disease environmental suitability forecasting, as well as communication to policy-makers, advisors and smallholder farmers. The system involves daily automated data flow between two continents during the wheat season in Ethiopia. The framework utilises expertise and environmental research infrastructures from within the cross-disciplinary spectrum of biology, agronomy, meteorology, computer science and telecommunications. The EWS successfully provided timely information to assist policy makers formulate decisions about allocation of limited stock of fungicide during the 2017 and 2018 wheat seasons. Wheat rust alerts and advisories were sent by short message service and reports to 10 000 development agents and approximately 275 000 smallholder farmers in Ethiopia who rely on wheat for subsistence and livelihood security. The framework represents one of the first advanced crop disease EWSs implemented in a developing country. It provides policy-makers, extension agents and farmers with timely, actionable information on priority diseases affecting a staple food crop. The framework together with the underpinning technologies are transferable to forecast wheat rusts in other regions and can be readily adapted for other wind-dispersed pests and disease of major agricultural crops.},

A total sample of 112 farmer teachers (FTs) and 560 follower farmers (FFs) who had adopted the PPT were randomly selected and interviewed between July and August 2007. The farm production constraints significantly reduced with an overall 53\% margin following PPT uptake. Overall, there were considerable benefits from training resulting in significant differences in understanding and applying of PPT. The farmers' extension strategy had a significant multiplier effect in increasing PPT uptake. The average TE by FTs was 78\% while FFs had 71\% suggesting room for improvement. The TE was influenced by farmers' interactions with neighbouring farmers, memberships in local groups, type of farmer, farmer's age, marital status and farmer's level of education. The efficiency can be improved by providing farmers with incentives and training, increasing field demonstrations, providing Desmodium seed and credit for other needed inputs to accelerate PPT transfer.

	abstract = {In the absence of adequate extension services, retailers have become the major information source for farmers' pesticide use in rural China. Pesticide application for smallholders is rather complex, and mistakes can lead to significant crop losses. Farmers, therefore, seek sources of information regarding pesticide use. This paper first explores how different kinds of retailers may employ different strategies of providing information to farmers. We find that for village, town, and county retailers, the more familiar they are with farmers, the more likely they are to amplify the recommended dosage of pesticide use. In cooperatives, who buy pesticides from an extension station, the information is directly transferred to member farmers without information distortion. Apart from examining retailers' different strategies of information provision, this paper also asks in how far farmers' trust in retailers may affect pesticide use. It finds that trust in different kinds of retailers indeed varies and plays a critical role in converting information into farming behavior. Members of the cooperative show rather high levels of trust in their retailer, while farmers who are not members of a cooperative show low levels of trust in retailers. Pesticide use is a joint result of retailers' information provision strategies and farmers' trust. The lowest pesticide use occurs when accurate information is provided and when farmers highly trust the information provider. Overuse occurs with either information distortion or low levels of trust. Cooperatives have advantages both in terms of information provision and trust, thereby leading to the lowest use of pesticides. (C) 2014 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.

Weather and climate services can improve climate risks to development by informing plans and decisions that ultimately reduce losses/maximize beneficial opportunities from climate variability and change. Yet, such services are typically highly aggregated, and notoriously difficult to communicate, especially to smallholder farmers and pastoralists where the need is greatest. Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) are decentralizing service provision, and in so doing, offering disaggregated, contextualized, and more easily understandable localized weather and seasonal information products relative to national level equivalents. This article uses household productive income (2014-2015) across Kitui County to model the economic value of KMD's local seasonal forecast and advisory products. The findings suggest that, after controlling for alternative explanations, households receiving KMD's local advisories and seasonal forecasts have marginally higher income levels compared to the counterfactual of using national level equivalents. When marginal appreciations in productive income are compared to the costs of establishing and maintaining KMD's decentralized provision, the investment is economically viable and comparable with similar initiatives within and outside Kenya.},

	abstract = {A study conducted in three Tanzanian Districts in 2000 focused attention on stakeholders who have leadership, administrative, and various technical and development roles in relation to smallholders and cashew production. These stakeholders to a large extent shared the same perception of why and how sulphur fungicide must be used to ensure cashew production in the face of a perceived disease threat from powdery mildew disease (Oidium anacardii Noack). A standardised sulphur-based strategy for control of this serious disease was strongly favoured by the shared understanding, and by a coalition of organisational and financial resources of influential stakeholders. Major efforts to promote alternative knowledge and understanding about powdery mildew disease and its integrated control have, to a disturbing extent, not reached either the majority of producers or other stakeholders. Important factors limiting access to this knowledge were: poor integration of the knowledge and other resource networks of farmers and key non-farming stakeholders with official sources of alternative cashew crop protection and IPM information; ambiguity amongst researchers and development practitioners concerning the potential of IPM in cashew; deficient communication methods; and limited ideas on how to promote the active learning required for IPM. Researchers' understanding of the potential for IPM in cashew can be enriched through study of those farmers who have begun to practice their own local forms of IPM. Ways to enhance wider communication and testing of IPM concepts are suggested. These measures can help the emergence of a stronger consensus within the research establishment, and amongst intermediary and end-users of powdery mildew disease control information, for more vigorous development, promotion and use of IPM strategies in cashew powdery mildew control.},

A two-section questionnaire was administered to 233 smallholder livestock and poultry farmers randomly selected from 573 smallholders in Phu Cat district of Vietnam. A binary logistic regression model was used to analyse the data. This study found that young smallholders who live close to an electricity base, with higher education levels, higher income, own large farms, participate in credit/training programmes, and who are members of community-based organisations, have a greater tendency to use mobile phones for livestock and poultry marketing. Subsidy and the provision of technical short course training on the use of mobile phones for smallholder livestock and poultry farmers are important extension strategies that can strengthen the adoption of mobile phones by smallholders for marketing, and this strategy should be delivered via community-based organisations.},

	abstract = {Agricultural extension in Indonesia has undergone major policy changes, depending on the government in power. In particular, since 1998, the government passed Law No 16/2006, aimed at making the extension system more democratic and participatory, especially for smallholder farmers. Law No. 16/2006 is in line with the “pluralistic and demand-driven extension approach” adopted by many developing countries since 2000, which allowed public and private extension systems to exist side-byside. Success of the new extension approach rests on the degree to which extension workers are able to mobilize smallholder farmers for “demand-driven” development that bases extension on smallholder farmers' needs. This survey of 78 public extension workers in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia examined challenges in implementing the pluralistic and demand-driven extension approach, including training needed to help extension workers deal more effectively with these challenges. The study found that the challenges relate to agreeing on extension goals; eliciting collaboration with non-government agencies and other development partners; and using ICTs to narrow the farmers-to-agent ratio. In general, the study found that extension workers need training in communication and development, also known as communication for development (C4D) to effectively facilitate development and navigate the increasing complexity of development programming in the 21st century. Thus, we recommend C4D training for extension workers as a way of enhancing their effectiveness. Fortunately, the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are promoting this strategy. Therefore, we urge the government of Indonesia to explore C4D as a strategy for strengthening extension in the country.},

Nonetheless, such opportunities are often lost largely due to unfavorable regulations imposed on harvesting and marketing of timber. Adverse impacts are worsened because the regulations are not effectively communicated to smallholder farmers. We assessed the level of smallholder knowledge of existing regulations and found it very low. In part, this correlated to their socio-demographic characteristics. Poor literacy skills and a low level of education make it difficult for older farmers' to increase their knowledge. This is compounded by the limited information channels that can reach the farmers. Improving smallholders' knowledge by providing information concerning markets and regulations in a timely and clear manner could help smallholders exercise coping strategies and priorities when selling their timber that would in turn reduce the negative impacts of regulations. The roles of village authorities could be crucial. They are close to the smallholders and could channel the information. The government could provide training and incentives for them to be more active in communicating the regulations to the smallholders.},

	abstract = {Despite concerted efforts, achieving the goal of universal food security remains challenging. Food security interventions occur at different levels of systemic depth. Some interventions target visible supply-side gaps, while others focus on deeper systemic problems in the food system. Here, we used a leverage points perspective to ask how multiple types of more superficial (shallow) and more fundamental (deep) interventions in the food system interact. Focusing on a case study in southwestern Ethiopia, we examined (1) recent changes in formal and informal institutions related to food security; (2) the effects of formal and informal institutions on the food system at different levels of systemic depth (i.e., on parameters, feedbacks, design, and intent); and (3) issues of institutional interplay between formal and informal institutions. We surveyed 150 rural households and analyzed key policy documents. Both formal and informal institutions were perceived to improve food security. However, at the intent level, formal institutions primarily aimed to enhance food supply, while informal institutions additionally sought to build trust among farmers. At the design level, formal interventions targeted information flow through a newly created agricultural extension system, while informal institutions facilitated labor sharing and communication. In terms of institutional interplay, new formal institutions had partly undermined pre-existing informal institutions. We conclude that both visible supply-side gaps and deeper drivers of food insecurity should be targeted through food security interventions. Interventions need to be cognizant of potentially unexpected ways of institutional interplay, especially between formal and informal institutions.},

	abstract = {The risks posed for disease introduction and spread are believed to be higher for smallholder livestock producers than commercial producers. Possible reasons for this is the notion that smallholders do not implement appropriate animal health management practices and are not part of traditional livestock communication networks. These factors contribute to the effectiveness of passive disease surveillance systems. A cross-sectional study, using a postal survey (n = 1,140) and group interviews (28 participants in three groups), was conducted to understand the animal health management and communication practices of smallholders keeping sheep, cattle, pigs, dairy goats and alpacas in Australia. These practices are crucial for an effective passive surveillance system. Findings indicate that there is a need for improvement in animal health management practices, such as contact with veterinarians and attitudes toward reporting. Results also indicate that these practices differ depending on the livestock species kept, with sheep ownership being associated with lower engagement with surveillance activities and smallholders keeping dairy goats and alpacas having in general better practices. Other factors associated with surveillance practices among participant smallholders are gender and years of experience raising livestock. Despite the differences observed, over 80\% of all smallholders actively seek information on the health of their livestock, with private veterinarians considered to be a trusted source. Emergency animal diseases are not a priority among smallholders, however they are concerned about the health of their animals. The finding that veterinarians were identified by producers to be the first point of contact in the event of unusual signs of disease, strengthens the argument that private veterinarians play a vital role in improving passive surveillance. Other producers are also a point of contact for animal health advice, with government agencies less likely to be contacted. The effectiveness of on-farm passive surveillance could be enhanced by developing strategies involving both private veterinarians and producers as key stakeholders, which aim to improve awareness of disease and disease reporting responsibilities.},

However limited understanding, incorrect information and a negative mindset could hinder the successful adoption of this practice. This case study of smallholder farmers in Penablanca, Cagayan, Philippines attempts to explain the farmers' adaptation practices by analyzing their knowledge and attitudes on climate change and agroforestry. Two sets of surveys, one on adaptation practices (n=600) and one on knowledge and attitudes (n=41) were conducted with smallholder farmers in Pefiablanca. Most farmers are aware of the basic concepts of climate change (91\%) and agroforestry (84\%), specifically of the impacts of climate extremes on their farms and of the benefits of agroforestry. However this may not always translate to correct practice of agroforestry and other adaptation measures. It is recommended that information, education, and communication programs on climate change and agroforestry for farmers should present targeted information on impacts and adaptation in a way that is relatable and understandable to them.},

	abstract = {Smallholders play a key role in implementing best management practices that increase productivity and reduce environmental effects. However, they often lack the knowledge to implement these standards. This study investigates if and how RSPO certification fosters upstream learning to improve farming practices. Taking a comparative approach between Thailand and Indonesia we find that the current structure of the value chain is not always well-suited for upstream learning beyond knowledge transfer. In particular, farmers in Indonesia suffer from the delegation of practices to the mill and cooperative, and from incentive-incompatible pricing practices, limiting the extent to which farmers absorb new knowledge on farming practices. In Thailand instead, price incentives based on quality are more developed, and only hindered by the presence of intermediary collectors. This makes that Thai farmers are systematically more aware of farming and environmental practices, and more likely to report compliance with RSPO principles and criteria. Their relatively higher independence in farming decision-making, however, results in weaker peer-to-peer interactions and higher deviations from best management practices, with consequences both for productivity and quality. This research highlights the major bottlenecks in upstream learning within RSPO-certified palm oil value chains in Indonesia and Thailand. Addressing such bottlenecks is a precondition to improving smallholders' farming practices.},

Our findings revealed adoption complimentary but no evidence of substitutability among adaptation strategies. The multivariate probit model estimation showed that household heads education level, gender, farmland soil fertility, access to extension service, credit access, climate information and key assets ownership are the key determinants of adoptions. The likelihood of adoption decreased when average long-term rainfall increased. In terms of the interaction effect between gender and access to credit, the study found that women-headed households with access to credit were more likely to use a higher number of adaptation strategies relative to women-headed households without access to credit. The significant factors for each strategy were different that entails how important it is to consider their unique characteristics in policy design and interventions. As per the finding, policy makers should consider gender-disaggregated interventions.

	abstract = {In August 2015, a rabies outbreak occurred in bovines in a Punjab village, India; subsequently, a farmer in the same village died of rabies in October 2015. We surveyed farmers to describe the outbreak, the demographics and rabies prophylaxis administered to householders on case farms, and farmers' knowledge of rabies prevention and treatment. We used multiple correspondence analysis to guide investigation of associations between demographics, farm status and rabies knowledge, attitudes and practices. The number of affected bovines was unusually high; 15 cattle and buffalo died on 13 smallholder farms (attack rate 4\%). Post-exposure vaccinations were administered to 24 people (median 2 doses). Affected farms had significantly larger households and were more likely to keep their livestock outside (therefore, accessible by stray dogs), suggesting that the impact of the outbreak was disproportionally borne by households of lower socio-economic status. Primary sources of rabies information were friends and neighbours, not health authorities or media. Women who had not received formal education were less likely to have heard of rabies. Although case farm participants were more likely to have heard about rabies from a veterinarian, their knowledge and practices to prevent rabies did not reflect the level expected considering their contact with a health professional; they were more likely to believe that traditional remedies prevent rabies and less likely to tell their children to avoid playing with stray dogs than participants from other farms. This study highlights knowledge dissemination disparities that, if typical of rural locations, could obstruct attempts to eliminate canine-mediated human rabies in India. Therefore, understanding the pervasiveness and influence of traditional medical beliefs on treatment-seeking behaviour, communication structures within villages and the impact of local practices such as carcass disposal on dog populations will be essential to ensure that rabies control strategies are effective in rural India.},

Using attributes derived from positive psychological capital as proxies for entrepreneurship and data collected from 458 smallholders in and around irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal, the study empirically examines factors affecting smallholder engagement in entrepreneurship activities. Findings show that access to extension and information from scheme committees, being a male farmer, having more earned income, membership to a cooperative and access to markets have a positive effect on farmers' entrepreneurial behaviour. Factors inhibiting entrepreneurship in the context of smallholder farming include land tenure insecurity, access to land without the necessary complementary resources, consumption credit and staying far away from irrigation schemes. The study recommends addressing gender bias regarding access to resources and information. Promoting interactive learning through networking will also result in positive entrepreneurial behaviour. There is also a need for the provision of demand-driven extension services, facilitation of market linkages and enhancing access to finance for would-be entrepreneurs. Access to credit should be directly linked to agricultural production through input vouchers and value chain financing. Addressing land tenure issues along with access to other complementary resources, inputs and services will also enhance on-farm entrepreneurship in the smallholder agriculture sector.},

	abstract = {The study investigates whether access to agricultural extension services enhances the well-known positive impact of adopting Drought Tolerant Maize (DTM) technology on livelihood outcomes; maize yield, output per capita, consumption and sales using a representative dataset of smallholder farming households from Zimbabwe. The empirical analysis adopts an instrumental variable regression model that incorporates an endogenous interaction term to capture the intermediary role of institutional extension services. Results reveal that access to agricultural extension services enhances the relationship between DTM adoption and maize yield, output per capita, and consumption but appears to weaken the association between DTM adoption and the amount of maize set aside for sale. In exploring the potential reasons why access to institutional extension services might enhance the DTM adoption-livelihood outcomes relationship, the results suggest mechanisms related to the use of basal fertilizers, use of organic manure, access to agricultural credit, use of certified DTM seed, access to general production and marketing information, weeding frequency and disease control which are more likely to be influenced by access to agricultural extension services. The findings suggest that policies targeted at improving DTM adoption as a climate-smart agricultural technology to improve resilience of smallholder maize farming households to climate variability and change must be complemented by revitalized agriculture extension services. Revitalization of extension services may come through capacity building of extension institutions, and their personnel, improving agricultural extension infrastructure, mobility of extension personnel, and increased financing to such institutions.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The main purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of farmer-oriented policies as regards the Iranian agricultural extension system. Methodology: To fulfill this objective, a Delphi technique was utilized. The study used a series of three steps, engaging a panel of experts on farmer-oriented policies of agricultural extension system. Finding: The characteristics of farmer-oriented policies in agricultural extension system were classified into six categories including: need-based programs, proper interaction among stakeholders, decentralization and higher stakeholders' participation, enabling stakeholders with emphasis on smallholder farmers, market-oriented programs and integrated policies. The findings indicated that ` enabling farmers to solve their technical problems' and ` engaging farmers in planning, executing and evaluating of the programs' had the highest percentage of agreement. Theoretical implication: From a theoretical point of view, the finding of this research has introduced six categories as characteristics of a farmer-oriented policy that could have practical implications for agricultural extension system in Iran. Also, this paper proposes a framework for future studies in the field of farmer-oriented policies in agricultural extension system. Practical implications: Recognizing the characteristics of farmer-oriented intervention of agricultural extension shows that targeted extension approaches are needed to pay attention to these characteristics in various stages of planning, delivering and evaluation of extension programs. Originality/value: This paper provides a comprehensive list of characteristics of farmer-oriented policies of agricultural extension that can be helpful for agricultural policy-makers in devising programs of extension services.},

	abstract = {Climate change is an environmental process that is among the most limiting factors for increasing or even maintaining food production by small-farmer communities in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Adoption of climate change adaptation strategies that increase agricultural productivity and at the same time building farmers' resilience capacity has become a top policy priority in SSA. In this study, we investigate how maize-dependent smallholders in Ethiopia adapt to climate change. Both household and plot-level data were collected, and subsequently analysed by a multivariate probit regression model. Results show that most climate change adaptation strategies implemented by maize-dependent smallholders, are complementary. Combining conservation tillage, mixed maize-legume cropping and terracing along with the use of drought-resistant maize varieties allows farmers to increase productivity while building resilience to climate change more than a subset of these strategies. Findings indicate that the likelihood of adopting soil and water conservation practices, drought-resistant maize varieties and chemical fertilizers significantly increase among young and male-headed households as well as farmers having confidence in extension agents and membership in local organisations. Hence, policies should aim at further building agricultural extension agents' capacity by providing effective and continuous education and training on climate change impacts and responses. Promoting family ties and household memberships in local organisations through facilitating mutual cooperation and communication among farming communities would help to foster adoption of climate change adaptation strategies.},

Invariably, most of the smallholders are less productive than commercial farmers and continue to lag in commercialization. Apart from the various multifaceted challenges which smallholder farmers face, limited access to extension services stands as the underlying constraint to their sustainability. Across Africa and Asia, public extension is envisioned as a fundamental part of the process of transforming smallholder farmers because it is their major source of agricultural information. Extension continues to be deployed using different approaches which are evolving. For many decades, various authors have reported the importance of the approaches that effectively revitalize extension systems and have attempted to fit them into various typologies. However, there is a widespread concern over the inefficiency of these extension approaches in driving the sustainability of smallholder farming agenda. Further, most of the approaches that attempted to revolutionize extension have been developed and brought into the field in rapid succession, but with little or no impact at the farmer level. This paper explores the theory and application of agricultural extension approaches and argues the potential of transforming them using digital technologies. The adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as mobile phones and the internet which are envisaged to revolutionize existing extension systems and contribute towards the sustainability of smallholder farming systems is recommended.},

This paper, therefore, explores the values of social connectedness within locally established societies' mutual support associations for agricultural innovations. This study explains how mutual support social network associations trigger agricultural innovations and the way farmers utilize such networks to spiral agricultural innovations. Indigenous mutual support associations like Guuza, Iqubi and Afoosha function in trust-based self-enforcing orders, social networks and relationships in a more flexible and reciprocity-based order. These informal social networks are employed by farmers to collaborate on society's mutual support practices. Trust, norms and group membership are the key components of social capital within indigenous mutual support associations. The social connectedness within the sort of labor-sharing arrangement, informal financial group, funeral association and inter-village link aids member's collective capacity to figure the development of agricultural innovations. Inherently embedded social networks, mutual support, information sharing, interaction and trust among the members within mutual support associations are the values for the event of agricultural innovations. Therefore, this study concludes that stakeholders within extension systems should support and strengthen the locally established society's associations to broaden agricultural innovations. In general, this study recommends the necessity to integrate the applications of society's mutual support associations for the development of agricultural innovations.},

	abstract = {Recent years have marked the emergence of the innovation systems approach as a shift from the conventional linear models of technology transfer. Linear technology diffusion models hinder participatory approaches of local actors such as smallholder farmers and regards them as spectators in the development process, which impedes wide adoption of technology by the intended beneficiary. This article sought to understand the potential of the innovations systems approach as an incentive to enhance the adoption of climate services by smallholder farmers through regarding them and other relevant stakeholders as part of the process, fostering knowledge sharing and interactive learning. The methodology included stakeholder/actor identification, mapping of stakeholder linkages, capacity building and active involvement of stakeholders through the climate services process. The results showed that unlike the conventional linear knowledge delivery process, the innovation systems approach takes into consideration the complex processes that are highlighted by non-linear processes, feedback loops, and other complex interactions that occur among heterogeneous actors. As such in place of the linear knowledge delivery approach, a more systems approach is necessary to help mobilize science and technology such as climate services to deliver benefits, which has the potential to enhance access, salience, credibility and legitimacy of the scientific information.

To address this shortcoming, this study adopts an interpretive approach, to assess the influence of mobile phone use in farming and its effect on the livelihoods of poor rural farmers. Analysing interviews from farmers in a rural Nigerian agrarian community based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA), the findings reveal that the ease of communications, social interactions, improved farm skills and knowledge afforded by mobile phone use leads to improved opportunities for farmers. These opportunities resonate in the entire farming value chain thereby enhancing farmers' livelihoods. However, some human capital deficiencies and contextual factors bordering on language barrier, lack of capability and awareness in the use of mobile phone features and functionalities inhibit farmers from benefiting optimally from the leverages provided by mobile phones. This calls for policies geared towards capacity building and sensitization of the rural populace on the prospects of mobile phone use in farming.},

This has largely been the case with small-scale farmers in rural areas in developing countries where mobile technologies have penetrated more than most other ICT tools.

This paper seeks to examine the way mobile phones are used for information access in situations where agricultural extension workers are a critical intermediary in the agricultural information services. Interviews were conducted with 10 randomly selected farmers who were part of the Dzindi irrigation scheme. The findings were that from the variety of information available to the farmers the most important source was the extension officer. The extension officer and the radio were indicated to be the most reliable independent sources of information. The other sources, such as the radio, family members, and friends, suppliers of chemicals, books and magazines, were only considered reliable if the information could be verified or vouched for by the extension officer. Increasing the information handling skills of extension officers, training of farmers to use smart features of their phones and promoting the usual face-to-face communication and use of conventional methods, which is what usually gives rise to the mediation of mobile phones, were recommended.},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: The term “traditional” is well established in European (human) medicine and even appears in recent European regulations on herbal medicinal products connected to a simplified registration. In contrast, a scientific discussion of a Traditional European Veterinary Herbal Medicine is still lacking in spite of a rising interest, in herbal medicine for animals in particular of veterinarians. There is only limited systematic ethnoveterinary research in Europe, with exception of the Mediterranean region, Switzerland and Austria. We conducted a survey on the ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers in the pre-alpine and alpine regions of the Swiss cantons of Bern and Lucerne. We compared the findings with earlier studies conducted in Switzerland and with recent and past human and veterinary medicinal literature. Aim of the study: We wanted to know to what extent (dependent to different definition of the term “traditional”) the ethnoveterinary knowledge of Swiss farmers could be considered as “traditional” in a European veterinary medicinal context. Material and methods: Semistructured interviews with 44 dialog partners, mainly smallholder cattle farmers, were conducted in 2014. Detailed information about homemade herbal remedies (plant species, plant part, manufacturing process) and the corresponding use reports (target animal species, category of use, route of administration, dosage, source of knowledge, frequency of use, last time of use and farmers satisfaction) were collected. To compare our data with literature, one German book of veterinary pharmacology published in 1900, one typescript of Swiss lectures in veterinary pharmacology from 1944, four books of veterinary herbal medicine published between 1984 and 2016, and one recent publication comparing current Swiss (human) ethnomedicinal plant knowledge with modern and past literature were analyzed. Results: Information on a total of 315 homemade remedies containing one single plant species (homemade single species herbal remedy reports, HSHR) was collected from participating farmers. These HSHR were prepared from 83 plant species belonging to 46 botanical families. Plants of the families Asteraceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae were most frequently used. Matricaria recutita L., Calendula officinalis L., Quercus robur L., Thymus vulgaris L. and Symphyturn officinale L. were the most frequently documented species. A total of 404 use reports (UR) were gathered for the 315 HSHR. The largest number of UR was for treatments of gastrointestinal disorders and metabolic dysfunctions, followed by skin alterations and sores. For more than half of the UR the source of knowledge was family, ancestors and friends, and for approximately one quarter the information was from courses and other educational events. For nearly 90\% of the UR farmers mentioned at least one use during the last 10 years, and in more than 50\% of the UR the last use was within the past year. Compared with recent and past literature and depending on different definitions of the term “traditional” as used for human medicine, between 43\% and 84\% of all 83 and between 57\% and 100\% of the most often mentioned 21 plant species show a “traditional” European veterinary use. Conclusion: For the treatment of their animals farmers in the pre-alpine and alpine regions of the Swiss cantons of Bern and Lucerne mostly used plants which have a track record as medicinal herbs in Europe over several centuries. Almost half of the plant species had specific veterinary uses for about 120 years and even more for at least 30 years. The majority of the plant species thus fulfill the criteria of “traditional” according to several definitions and even more up to a certain degree the criteria of “traditional use” as defined in European regulations for human medicinal products. Ethnoveterinary research combined with data from historical sources may serve as a sound foundation for the development and definition of a Traditional European Veterinary Herbal Medicine maybe even with regard to the recent discussion about a simplified registration for Traditional Herbal Veterinary Medicinal Products.},

	abstract = {Smallholder livestock producers are a diverse population with wide ranging motivations for keeping livestock. The biosecurity risk posed by smallholders has been the subject of much conjecture, with comparisons often made between the level of animal health and biosecurity knowledge of smallholders, versus that of commercial livestock producers. This research aimed to gain a better understanding of current knowledge of smallholder production in Australia, particularly in relation to biosecurity and emergency animal disease, and to investigate the relationships that exist between smallholders and the organisations and individuals from which they seek information, assistance and support. Engagement with stakeholders is an important component of an effective biosecurity communication strategy as the dissemination of biosecurity related information from a single source cannot be expected to satisfy the needs of such a broad ranging population. A qualitative study involving a review of literature, semi-structured interviews with government and non-government stakeholders and the development of smallholder and stakeholder influence and interest grids was undertaken. This paper forms part of a broader mixed methods research project among smallholders. Results from the stakeholder analysis showed variation in the parameters used to define smallholders and in the level of stakeholder involvement. Smallholders identified breeding consultants, other producers, private veterinarians and family, friends and colleagues as having a significant to high level of interest and potential to influence their practices. Government agencies were perceived to only have some level of interest but significant influence. Industry stakeholders and rural suppliers were positioned in the quadrant reflecting perceived low levels of interest and influence. The interest and influence grid developed from stakeholder's perspectives demonstrate a clustering around the mid points for both interest and influence, with the exception of those from industry who described low levels of interest and influence. Commonwealth and State government stakeholders reported a higher level of interest than influence. Veterinarians, both government and private, reported some to significant levels of interest and influence. In contrast to the results from the smallholder grid, rural suppliers reported relatively high levels of both interest and influence. The current study demonstrates that to maximise the effectiveness of biosecurity communication, there is a need for government and industry organisations to further engage with all stakeholders involved with smallholders.

	abstract = {Climatic change has a negative impact on people's livelihoods, agriculture, freshwater supply and other natural resources that are important for human survival. Therefore, understanding how rural smallholder farmers perceive climate change, climate variability, and factors that influence their choices would facilitate a better understanding of how these farmers adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. A Zero-inflated double hurdle model was employed to estimate the factors influencing farmers' adoption of adaptation strategies and intensity of adoption at the household level in South Africa. Different socioeconomic factors such as gender, age, and experience in crop farming, institutional factors like access to extension services, and access to climate change information significantly influenced the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among beneficiaries of land reform in South Africa. Concerning intensity of adoption, age, educational level, farming experience, on-farm training, off-farm income, access to information through ICT and locational variables are the significant determinants of intensity of adaptation strategies. Thus, education attainment, non-farm employment, farming experience are significant incentives to enhance smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity through the adoption of many adaptation approaches. This study therefore concluded that farm-level policy efforts that aim to improve rural development should focus on farmers' education, on-farm demonstration and non-farm employment opportunities that seek to engage the farmers, particularly during the off-cropping season. The income from non-farm employment can be plough-back into farm operations such as the adoption of soil and water conservation, use of improved planting varieties, insurance, among others to mitigate climate variability and subsequently increase productivity. Policies and investment strategies of the government should be geared towards supporting education, providing on-farm demonstration trainings, and disseminating information about climate change adaptation strategies, particularly for smallholder farmers in the country. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations around the agricultural extension system and education on climate change using information and communication technologies.},

We use the notions of institutional carriers and activity systems to study the evolution of the prevailing “smallholder” institutional logic of Ghanaian agriculture toward an incoming “value-chain” institutional logic concerned with linking farmers to output markets, improving the knowledge base in agriculture, and increasing its information intensity. We draw on a mixed-methods approach, including in-depth qualitative interviews, focus groups, observations, and detailed secondary quantitative data. We cultivate activity theory as a practice based lens for structuring inquiry into institutional change. We find that information artifacts served to link the activities of farmers that were embedded in the smallholder logic with those of agricultural-development actors that promoted the value-chain logic. Hybridization occurred through the use of artifacts with different interaction modalities. In terms of conceptualizing change, our findings suggest that hybridization of the two logics may be an intermediary point in the long transition from the smallholder toward the value-chain logic.},

Most existing literature on the impact of mobile phones in farming has examined the various components of the farming cycle in isolation, and failed to holistically account for the complex interactions and relationships between these components. In this study, we combine the strengths of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) and Systems Theory (ST) as a theoretical lens to understand the impact of mobile phone use in farming and its developmental contributions on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in post-insurgency northeast Nigeria. On the basis of empirical data and literature, we develop a qualitative system dynamics model depicting mobile phone use in farming. The main feedback loops show that the greatest bane to farming in the area is insecurity and climate variability. However, better access to information and communications afforded by mobile phones empowers farmers and enables them to overcome these vulnerabilities. The use of feedback loops in analysis provides rigour and depth to the findings due to their ability to demonstrate the interdependencies between system components. We contribute to knowledge and inform practice by extending the understanding of the impact of mobile phone use in farming through system dynmics modelling.},

However, empirical evidence of the impact of ICT-enabled extension on farmers' uptake of introduced technologies remains scarce. This four-year study evaluates an ICT-enabled extension project in Senegal using radio and mobile phone services to encourage rural smallholder farmers' use of certified improved seeds and organic and inorganic fertilizers across Senegal. Data were collected using large-scale annual surveys in six regions over four years as well as focus groups. The findings suggest that, in general, the forms and format of ICTenabled extension services deployed failed to significantly contribute to the adoption of promoted technologies. Personal connections to participatory farm trials were consistently associated with adoption, and phone-based voice messaging appears to have potential to increase technology uptake. Gender based disparities in engagement with ICT services and Senegal's poorly developed systems for producing and distributing quality seeds emerged as key factors limiting the effectiveness of this project. These findings raise concerns about the equity and effectiveness of ICT-enabled extension in promoting agricultural inputs in contexts like Senegal and have important implications for similar efforts in other countries.

	abstract = {The adoption of sustainable residue management practices is considered as a cleaner production option for the agricultural sector. However, limited information is available from Pakistan on the current use and adoption of sustainable residue management practices and different socio-physiological factors are involved in the process of shaping farmers' intentions. Based on the protection motivation theory framework, this study analyzes the socio-physiological factors affecting the farmers' intentions on adopting sustainable crop residue management practices. The paper is based on cross-sectional data collected from 420 farmers across Punjab and employs a structural equation modeling to explore research objectives. The research findings show that farmers, who perceive high risk from crop residue burning or who are aware of its negative consequences, are more intended to adopt sustainable crop residue management practices. However, their adoption intentions do have significant relationship with the self-efficacy implying the lack of resources, time, knowledge, competency, and skills as constraints limiting the adoption of cleaner production strategies. Further, the research findings also confirm the positive and significant role of habits of farmers in shaping their intentions to use sustainable crop residue management practices. In addition to this, the paper found a positive and significant role in social interaction, sources of information and access to extension services in shaping farmers' decision regarding sustainable residue management practices at the farm level. The research findings suggest enhancing awareness to highlight the negative impacts of crop residue burning and to train them regarding useful and sustainable crop residue management options that are not only cleaner production options but also generate economic benefits for farmers.

Here, a comprehensive participatory pipeline is described that included 56 Nepalese women farmer editors to develop 100 picture-based lessons. Thereafter, the Theory of Planned Behavior is used as a framework to evaluate 20 diverse lessons using quantitative and qualitative data (Nvivo-11) collected from four groups, focusing on low-literacy women: the women farmer editors (n = 56); smallholder field testers who had prior exposure to extension agents and the actual innovations (control group, n = 120), and those who did not (test group, n = 60); expert stakeholders (extension agents/scientists, n = 25). The expected comprehension difference between farmer groups was non-substantive, suggesting that the participatory editing/testing approaches were effective. There were surprising findings compared to the academic literature: smallholders comprehended the pictures without the help of extension agents, perhaps because of the participatory approaches used; children assisted their mothers to understand caption-based lessons; the farmers preferred printed pictures compared to advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs); and the resource-poor farmers were willing to pay for the printed materials, sufficient to make them cost-neutral/scalable.

Zoonoses impose enormous burdens on low-income countries like Nepal, where populations are largely dependent on livestock production and access to shared grazing lands, often near protected areas, due to population pressures. Several livestock-associated zoonoses have been reported in Nepal; however, little is known regarding Nepali farmers' knowledge of zoonoses and opportunities for disease management. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate Nepali farmers' awareness of zoonoses, assess current health challenges, and evaluate disease prevention and control practices. We found that awareness of zoonotic pathogens was limited, especially in informally educated and illiterate farmers; the majority of which were women. Further, farmers' preventive herd health, food safety, and sanitation practices were not associated with their awareness. Several farmers reported high-risk practices despite being aware of zoonotic diseases, suggesting a disconnect between the farmers' awareness and practice. Our study highlights the need for improving Nepali farmers' knowledge of zoonoses and disease prevention measures. Closing these awareness-practice gaps will require an improved understanding of risk and effective drivers of behavior change, alongside engagement of farmers in development of zoonotic disease prevention programs that encourage participation of both male and female farmers across all levels of education.},

	abstract = {Conservation agriculture (CA) involves the practice of concurrent minimum tillage, permanent soil cover using crop residue, and crop rotation. Evidence indicates that CA increases agricultural productivity, reduces farming labour requirements, and improves soil quality. While CA is practised in several African contexts, little is known about its interaction with gender. This review synthesized knowledge on the interplay of gender and CA in sub-Saharan Africa. The review highlighted the relative neglect of gender issues in research on CA in SSA. Existing research was limited both in quantity and to a few countries in the region. There was also little critical focus on gender as a social phenomenon: a few of the studies conceptualized gender in terms of the socially constructed roles of men and women while the majority framed it in terms of the sexual categories of male and female. Compared to men, and due largely to gendered barriers, including lack of access to land; machinery; inputs; extension services; and credit facilities, women farmers adopted CA less and dis-adopted it more. CA increased women's incomes, labour involvement, household food security, as well as risks for land and crop dispossession by men when farming becomes lucrative. It also increased workloads, employment opportunities and health risks for women. CA positively altered gender relations, boosting women's participation in agricultural decision-making at the household level. Deliberately enlisting women as beneficiaries; working with men to advance their understanding of women's needs in agriculture; and offering agricultural inputs directly to women are some strategies that enhanced women's participation in CA. Gaps in current research on gender and CA include: critical focus on and understanding of gender as a social construct in relation to CA; the long-term impacts on CA for gender relations, incomes for men and women, and women's empowerment; the sustainability of strategies for supporting gendered participation in CA; and the dynamics of gendered access to local farmland markets for CA.},

Universities are among the institutions with the responsibility to build up these competences. Universities are criticized though for focusing on academic and research roles with minimal impact on communities. Makerere University, Kampala, in response piloted a farmer entrepreneurship training project in a bid to effectively contribute to social transformation. The study assessed the influence of the training on smallholder farmers' competences, productivity and organizational capacity. Data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions with 184 farmers in the project and non-project farmers in northern Uganda. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using SPSS computer package and thematic content analysis, respectively. A multiple regression analysis using the ordinary least square was used to capture the combined influence of entrepreneurship training and other socioeconomic variables on the farmers' productivity. Our study findings show that the training had positively influenced farmers' entrepreneurial and organizational competences. Farmers acquired improved agronomic practices, business planning, value addition and packaging, branding and marketing knowledge and skills. Group leadership, accountability, communication, networking and marketing competencies of the farmers were strengthened. The project demonstrated a possible framework for developing country university efforts to impact on sustainable agricultural development. Integrating entrepreneurship aspects of technical and scientific knowledge, entrepreneurship, social and environmental awareness, experiential education and values and ethics into the curricula would provide universities with capacity to promote rural entrepreneurship.},

A total of 62 commercially oriented smallholder farmers under the Limpopo Industrial Development Corporation-Nguni cattle project were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data on farmers' demographic and farm characteristics, sources of information and communication channels used. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to evaluate factors that influenced farmers' choices of information sources and communications channels used. Findings show that government extension (53\% of the respondents) and other farmers (30\%) were the major sources of management information for the farmers. Based on the logistic regression results, the decision to choose government extension as the main source of information was mainly influenced by respondents' gender (p = 0.001) and access to training (p = 0.023). Communication was mainly through farm-to-farm visits (56\%) and the use of mobile phones (30\%). Based on the current findings, the infusion of modern information communication technologies such as mobile phone-based innovations with the existing government extension service could further strengthen the capacity of farmers to share information among themselves as well as providing feedback to extension agents. Furthermore, it is essential to take cognizance of farmers' socio-economic factors when identifying and characterizing their management information sources and communication strategies.},

The results are as follows. First, the study revealed that Internet use is affected by household total land holdings, access to credit and off-farm employment, education, being a member of an association and how household perceives the use of the internet and household head age. Second, regarding the quantitative relationship, Internet use can help increase farm productivity. Compared with males, the impact of female heads' Internet use on farm productivity is more prominent. Finally, the productivity effect of Internet use for farmers with no access to off-farm work is greater than that for those with off-farm work access.

	abstract = {Resilience is often considered a precondition for sustainable social-ecological systems. But how can this understanding of resilience be applied to food systems? We operationalized the concept by subdividing it into different resilience dimensions, namely: buffer capacity, self-organization, and capacity for learning and adaptation. Specific indicators were defined for each dimension: (1) agrobiodiversity and livelihood assets for buffer capacity; (2) decentralization and independence, local consumption of production, interest groups, ecological self-regulation, and connectivity for self-organization; and (3) knowledge of threats and opportunities, reflective and shared learning, feedback mechanisms, existence and use of local-traditional knowledge, and a shared food system vision for capacity for learning and adaptation. Next, we applied the resilience indicators to different food systems (agroindustrial, local, and agroecological) in Kenya and Bolivia, including assessment of the interaction and coexistence of food systems. While the contexts in the two countries differ greatly, we identified several common trends that appear to be undermining food system resilience in both settings. These trends include low ecological buffer capacity and self-regulation in agroindustrial food systems; strong disparities in income and access to productive resources; competition for water, land, and labor; exclusion from markets; and low human capital and feedback mechanisms in locally based, traditional food systems. Taken together, these trends cast doubt on food system coexistence narratives. Finally, the results enable us to identify leverage points in the food systems - e.g., regarding learning and feedback mechanisms that could be used to foster food system transformations linked to goals of sustainability and justice.},

The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment tool was used to conduct impact assessments on firewood-based improved cooking stoves to evaluate their contribution to food security at local stakeholder level. Between 2014 and 2017, four annual impact assessments were conducted with local stakeholders in four villages in the semi-arid Dodoma and the sub-humid Morogoro regions to assess the impact of improved cooking stoves on locally defined nine food security criteria. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment was used to (i) ex-ante identify the expected impact, and (ii) to ex-post assess the experienced impact of improved cooking stoves on the nine food security criteria. The impact assessments showed that the perceived contribution of improved cooking stoves towards the food security criteria was positive throughout all assessments. In particular, improved cooking stoves addressed relevant food security criteria such as social relations, food availability, and market participation. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment tool supported continuous knowledge exchange between scientists and local stakeholders, thus improving communication and co-learning; while identifying merits and demerits of the improved cooking stoves that could be addressed during the project lifetime.},

	abstract = {Increasing demand for land to ensure human food security in the future has already impelled agricultural production into marginal areas. The environmental conditions found there have a more pronounced impact on agricultural productivity than in the systems used so far under favourable conditions. In addition to this challenge, climate change is expected to increase the unreliability of weather conditions (through increased variability and occurrence of extremes) for farmers considerably. This unreliability is even more serious in developing countries' farming system where food security is vulnerable. Current efforts in digitalization offer great possibilities to improve farmers` decision-making processes. A wide range of online tools and smartphone applications is available to support both agricultural extension services and smallholder farmers alike. These apps are often parameterized and validated to certain environments and are troubled when applied to new geographical locations and different environmental conditions. We have conducted field trials to demonstrate potential methods to close knowledge gaps in the data background for one of these apps, RiceAdvice, concerning three key aspects: shifting of cropping calendar, adjustment of fertilizer management and genotype selection. Sites in Ethiopia, Madagascar and Rwanda were selected to represent altitudinal gradients, with overlapping elevations reflecting differences in temperature to enable cross-country comparisons. Planting dates were distributed throughout three calendar years, with continuous iterative planting dates taking place in Madagascar, in- and off-season planting dates in Rwanda with different fertilizer applications, and one planting date during each rainy season in Ethiopia with different management options. With these trials, we have been able to identify key data sets needed for the adaptation of agricultural decision support tools to new environments. These include the assessment of climatic constraints on innovations to cropping calendars (e.g. double cropping), informed selection of alternative varieties able to complete crucial parts of their phenological development to avoid temperature-related stress inducing, for example spikelet sterility in rice in late development stages and the effectivity of potential innovations in fertilizer management strategies.},

The main objectives of this study were to identify the key information exchange agents, understand the information flow path, rank the relative importance of the different information dissemination pathways, and determine weather forecast adoption. We conducted a household survey in five villages of Rim Kebele in Bahir Dar area and found that farmers communicate with four main agents with regard to information exchange. We developed an agent-based model to learn the adoption rates of weather forecast information. Agriculture extension agents were found to be the most influential members of the community. Farmers' communicating with neighboring village farmers showed higher adoption. Our results show at least twice that improvements in communication network attain higher adoption rates. Radio has also demonstrated positive uptake of information. We also found that forecast accuracy of 70\% is sufficient to achieve high adoption rates. Our findings might help decision-makers recognize critical information flow pathways and their relative importance, and identify barriers to disseminating weather forecast information in the community.},

	abstract = {We evaluated farmers' rationales to understand their decision making in relation to the use of fertile anthropogenic soils, i.e., Amazonian dark earths (ADE), and for dealing with changes in shifting cultivation in Central Amazonia. We analyzed qualitative information from 196 interviews with farmers in 21 riverine villages along the Madeira River. In order to decide about crop management options to attain their livelihood objectives, farmers rely on an integrated and dynamic understanding of their biophysical and social environment. Farmers associate fallow development with higher crop yields and lower weed pressure, but ADE is always associated with high yields and high weeding requirements. Amazonian dark earths are also seen as an opportunity to grow different crops and/or grow crops in more intensified management systems. However, farmers often maintain simultaneously intensive swiddens on ADE and extensive swiddens on nonanthropogenic soils. Farmers acknowledge numerous changes in their socioeconomic environment that affect their shifting cultivation systems, particularly their growing interaction with market economies and the incorporation of modern agricultural practices. Farmers considered that shifting cultivation systems on ADE tend to be more prone to changes leading to intensification, and we identified cases, e.g., swiddens used for watermelon cultivation, in which market demand led to overintensification and resulted in ADE degradation. This shows that increasing intensification can be a potential threat to ADE and can undermine the importance of these soils for agricultural production, for the conservation of agrobiodiversity, and for local livelihoods. Given that farmers have an integrated knowledge of their context and respond to socioeconomic and agro-ecological changes in their environment, we argue that understanding farmers' knowledge and rationales is crucial to identify sustainable pathways for the future of ADE and of smallholder agriculture in Amazonia.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa face multiple trade-offs when deciding on the allocation of their financial, labour and nutrient resources. Day-to-day decisions have implications for the sustainability of their farming system, implying multiple trade-offs between short- and long-term objectives that have biophysical and socio-economic dimensions. We show that inverse modelling techniques can be used effectively for optimisation and tradeoffs analysis of farming systems. By combining the multi-objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm and a crop/soil dynamic simulation model we were able to select farming strategies that resulted in the best possible trade-offs between different farming objectives. This integrated analytical tool allows optimisation. of farmers' goals similar to linear programming, but an advantage over linear programming is that the proposed method takes into account a wider spectrum of biophysical processes including their interactions and feedbacks. Tradeoffs between resource productivity, use efficiency and conservation in relation to different patterns of resource allocation were analysed for a maize-based, simplified case study farm from western Kenya (2.2 ha - comprising fields of poor, medium and high soil fertility), under three scenarios of financial liquidity to invest in labour and inputs (2000, 5000 and 10,000 KSh ha(-1); 75 KSh = 1 US\$). The maximum farm-scale maize production achieved was larger when financial resources increased. However, increasing maize yields above a certain threshold by applying mineral fertilisers was associated with larger N losses by leaching, runoff and soil erosion; such threshold was 2.7t grain ha(-1) for the scenario of no financial limitations (10,000 KSh ha(-1)). N losses at farm scale fluctuated between 36 and 54 kg N ha(-1) season, while the maximum maize yields achieved were around 3.4 t grain ha(-1). Soil losses by erosion increased abruptly beyond a certain maize yield (e.g. 1.8 t grain ha(-1) for the 2000 KSh ha(-1) scenario), while the minimum rate of soil loss differed between financial scenarios. Investments in hiring labour were pri-oritised over fertiliser use to obtain the greatest yields and the allocation of available resources favoured the more fertile fields. This inverse modelling exercise allowed us to analyse trade-offs between different farmers' objectives and to compare potential resource allocation strategies to achieve them. The set of strategies to achieve different goals was more numerous and variable when the conditions were less conducive for farming. This questions the validity of the prevailing model of extension/communication, based on generalised recommendations for resource-poor farmers in Africa. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Participating in research and development projects designed to increase the profitability and social outcomes from livestock production in smallholder crop-livestock systems provides valuable and rewarding learning experiences for scientists from Australia and partner countries. The majority of livestock in Asia are in these systems and any interventions to increase animal production need to consider the cropping activities of the farm, which vary considerably in relation to people, land and water resources, season length and the number and types of crops. Understanding the farming systems in enough depth is essential if interventions are to lead to improved outcomes for families. In this paper, we briefly consider the diversity and complexity of crop-livestock systems and the approach of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research in investing in research, development and extension for positive impacts from livestock production on the wellbeing of rural households in developing countries. An important approach to categorising livestock farmers to assess whether they are likely to be receptive to change is described. Consideration is given to the appropriateness of technologies, the need for sound science and the importance of capacity development in underpinning useful changes to systems. Because of the diversity and complexity of systems, systems-modelling is important in exploring options and interactions between components of the farming systems. Examples are given throughout the paper to emphasise learning from experience. The paper concludes with a list of the lessons learnt.},

An efficient endogenous switching regression model (ESRM) was used to estimate the impact of climate change adaptation strategy on the net income of rice farmers. The MVP results show that the socio-economic factors, the institutional factors, and locational variables of some households statistically influenced the choice of climate change adaptation strategies employed. Complementarities among all the adaptation strategies used by the farmers were revealed by the positive pair-wise correlation matrix of the MVP model. The study also indicated that farmers affected by prolonged drought and incidences of flood were more likely to adopt adaptation strategies on their farmlands. The ESRM treatment effect indicated that the average net income per rice farm of those who adopted the strategies was significantly higher than that of those who did not. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations related to agricultural extension systems and climate change education through information and communication technologies. This investment in education is essential for development and would encourage farmers to adopt appropriate climate change adaptation strategies.},

The study utilised a cross-sectional survey of a randomly selected sample of 116 KyD farmers in KwaZulu-Natal Province. A Logit model was used to analyse the data. The results show that more farmers are aware of farmgate market channels, but however, they tended to utilise auction market channels. Furthermore, gender, marital status, educational level, employment status, farm income, source of income, herd size, labour and training were significant variables in the awareness and use of butcheries, auctions and farm gate markets. The study concludes that the scheme is particularly effective in influencing commercialisation through utilisation of more lucrative market channels such as auctions. Furthermore, socio-economic factors had a bearing on the awareness and use of marketing channels for smallholder farmers in the KyD scheme. Labour was particularly significant across butchery, auction and farm gate market channels. The study recommends that the scheme needs to improve awareness and use of market channels through utilisation of information platforms such as radio, television and direct communication though mobile phones. Furthermore, extension should assist farmers not only in awareness of markets, but also in the utilisation of those markets.},

This region, which is known for its monsoon climate (which involves a distinct temporal and spatial variation in rainfall), has experienced a decrease in annual rainfall over the last century. This study is aimed at investigating how smallholder farmers perceive climate change and at identifying the methods that these smallholders use to adapt to climate change. We use data collected from a survey of 215 households to compare the climate vulnerability of three watershed communities in Kerala. We find that the farmers perceive substantial increases in both temperature and the unpredictability of monsoons; this is in accordance with actual observed weather trends. The selection of effective adaptation strategies is one of the key challenges that smallholders face as they seek to reduce their vulnerability. The surveyed households simultaneously use various adaptation methods, including information and communication technology, crop and farm diversification, social networking through cooperatives, and soil and water conservation measures. The results of a binary regression model reveal that the household head's age, education and gender, as well as the farm's size and the household's size, assets, livestock ownership, poverty status and use of extension services, are all significantly correlated with the households' choices regarding adaptations to cope with climate change.},

Fodder innovation, being only one element of livestock value chains, is sustainably enhanced when linked to other innovations and market-oriented activities that optimize productivity gains. Yet innovating smallholder farmers face systemic constraints to access markets, and need to organize in groups to exploit opportunities.

A descriptive statistical analysis was conducted, and Kendall's W-test and the chi-squared distribution test were deployed to categorize and evaluate the efficacy of the different methods of technology diffusion used by the Tunisian extension system. To address farmers' perceived opinions and classify the changes from the use of the improved technologies, a qualitative approach based on the Stapel scale was used. Farmer training, demonstration, and farmer-to-farmer interactions were perceived as the most effective agricultural extension methods. The access to technology, know-how, adoption cost of that technology, and labor intensity for adoption influenced its adoption level. Farmers' opinions about the changes resulting from the adoption of both technologies revealed that yield and resistance to drought were the most important impacts of the two technologies.

This scientific network brings together research and academic institutions, with expertise spanning a multidisciplinary perspective from biology and ecology to remote sensing, agronomy and integrated pest management. Its main scientific objective is to explore the potential of biodiversity and ecological processes such as pest regulation, enabling novel ecologically-based models for productive systems, reduction of pesticide use, and adaptation or resilience of farming systems in the face of environmental disruptions. From Northern Senegal to Southern Benin, the research group explores a wide range of ecoregions and socio-ecological contexts, including stakeholders and their objectives, land use and agricultural practices, and management of biodiversity for enhancing biological control. Main challenges to be turned into opportunities include (i) encouraging collaborations amongst researchers from different scientific fields, (ii) fostering interactive research and synergies among research institutions and among countries, and (iii) developing an ecological engineering approach for the design of sustainable agricultural systems for smallholder farmers.

At six milk collection centers, 63 farmers with 340 lactating cows participated in this research and demonstration of feed supplements, Farmers and cows were allotted to receive respective feed supplements: high-quality feed block (HQFB), high-quality feed pellet (HQFP), dried cassava leaf/cassava hay, dried leucaena leaf and cottonseed meal: 5\% urea treated rice straw was fed as a source of roughage throughout the feeding period of the dry season. Trainings and workshops were organized by the researchers at the University, research station, demonstration sites and on-farms. Regular visits to the farms by researchers and extension officers were made while discussions and demonstrations were performed in addition. Participating farmers also visited other farmers during the demonstration which offered a real practical perspective and farmers-to-farmers interaction. As a result of this participation and demonstration scheme, the farmers could learn more effectively and accepted the technology more readily, especially the practicality of the feed preparation, feed establishment, feeding method and feed reserve. Strategic supplementation of these feed supplements resulted in improving milk yield, milk quality, overall condition of the cows and higher income return through increased productivity and lower level use of concentrate to milk yield from 1:2 to 1:3 or lower. Based on this research and demonstration /participation scheme, all Feed supplements enhanced productivity, however the establishment of cassava hay on farms deserved more attention and warrants a wider developmental expansion among dairy farmers since it contained high rumen by-pass protein (tannin-protein complex) and could be easily produced and be sustainable on farms.},

By referring to the case in Madagascar, the paper discusses that creating a certain number of local trainers is effective because they function as a driver to promote tree growing and new livelihood activities introduced by external agents using locally available resources. One critical issue of being a local trainer is to have good communication skills in relation to fellow farmers. This issue can be addressed by sharing the importance of communication skills of local trainers in a community so that fellow farmers can facilitate local trainers' reflection unless a farmer does not feel reliable to a local trainer. On a mid- to longer-term basis, income opportunities will become an important point of motivation for local trainers. Creating new livelihood activities that can generate income and simultaneously contribute to village development is the way to go. This will enable local trainers to maintain their motivation and thus lead to sustainable tree growing activities.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-peer learning paradigm is seldom used in studying how farmers can increase yield. In this article, agent-based modelling has been applied to study the chances of dairy farmers increasing annual milk yield by learning better farming strategies from each other. Two sets of strategies were considered; in one set (S), each farmer agent would possess a number of farming strategies based on their knowledge, and in a second set (S'), farmer agents would possess farming strategies that they have adopted from their peers. Regression models were used to determine litres of milk that could be produced whenever new strategies were applied. By using data from Ethiopia and Tanzania, 28 and 25 determinants for increase in milk yield were fitted for the two countries, respectively. There was a significant increase in average milk yield as the farmer agents interacted and updated their S'- from baseline data, average milk yield of 12.7 +/- 4.89 and 13.62 +/- 4.47 to simulated milk yield average of 17.57 +/- 0.72 and 20.34 +/- 1.16 for Tanzania and Ethiopia, respectively. The peer-to-peer learning approach details an inexpensive method manageable by the farmers themselves. Its implementation could range from physical farmer groups to online interactions.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers are key actors in addressing the food and nutrition insecurity challenges facing the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), while also minimizing the ecological footprint of food production systems. However, fostering innovation in the region's smallholder farming systems will require more decentralized, adaptive, and heterogeneous institutional structures and approaches than presently exist. In this paper, we review the conditions that have been undermining sustainable food and nutrition security in the Caribbean, focusing on issues of history, economy, and innovation. Building on this discussion, we then argue for a different approach to agricultural development in the Small Island Developing States of the CARICOM that draws primarily on socioecological resilience and agricultural innovation systems frameworks. Research needs are subsequently identified, including the need to better understand how social capital can facilitate adaptive capacity in diverse smallholder farming contexts; how formal and informal institutions interact in domestic agriculture and food systems to affect collaboration, co-learning, and collective action; how social actors might better play bridging and linking roles that can support mutual learning, collaboration, and reciprocal knowledge flows; and the reasons underlying past innovation failures and successes to facilitate organizational learning.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2012.03.014},
	abstract = {The potential for tree components of coffee agroforestry systems to provide ecosystem services is widely recognized. Management practices are a key factor in the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided. There is relatively abundant information on ecosystem services provision within agroforestry systems, but comparatively scant information regarding how coffee farmers manage their plantations, the factors influencing their farming practices and the extent to which farmers' local knowledge - as opposed to global scientific understanding - underpins management decisions. Policymakers and scientists too frequently design development programs and projects in the coffee sector. On occasion technicians are included in the design process, but farmers and their knowledge are always excluded. This research explores farmers' knowledge regarding how trees affect coffee productivity and ecosystem services in Costa Rica. Farmers' knowledge on the effects of trees on coffee productivity was compared with that of other knowledge sources: coffee processors, technicians and scientists. Farmers were shown to have detailed knowledge regarding ecosystem services that their coffee agroforestry systems provide as well as on the interactions between trees and coffee productivity. When asked on the services that trees provide, farmers classified trees according to water protection, soil formation, or contribution to biodiversity conservation. These classifications were related to tree attributes such as leaf size, biomass production or root abundance. Comparison of coffee productivity knowledge from different knowledge sources revealed considerable complementarity and little contradiction. The effects of shade trees on biophysical conditions and their interactions with coffee productivity were well understood by farmers. They recorded and classified shade trees as `fresh' (suitable for integration with coffee) or `hot' (unsuitable) based on their leaf texture and size, foliage density, crown shape, and root system attributes. The fresh/hot classification significantly related to positive/negative provision of services. This classification was widely used by farmers, and unknown by coffee technicians. Detailed local knowledge included several different topics, such as the role of trees in soil formation and in abundance of pollinators. Farmers were also aware of the influence of these ecosystem services on crop productivity. Generally, management decisions were made to maintain coffee productivity rather than ecosystem services. Based on these results, it is suggested that technical interventions addressing the improvement of coffee plantations are more likely to be successful if they take into account not only the scientific information on agroforestry interactions but also the knowledge possessed by farmers. Lack of comprehension of local coffee knowledge could be expected to reduce the success of development programs and projects aimed at improving productivity or other ecosystem services.

Tree-crop interactions and the biophysical and socio-economic factors influencing farmers' decision-making about companion trees are complex and context-specific but fine scale data relating to them are rarely available. A novel method was used to analyse trees ranked by farmers for a range of attributes and evaluate the consistency of farmers' knowledge underpinning decisions about tree management in coffee production systems in Rwanda. Farmers' knowledge about tree planting was changing, in line with new shade management recommendations being promoted alongside a limited number of tree species, often freely distributed through eco-certification initiatives. Farmers had detailed knowledge about soil and water conservation processes associated with trees, but they traded these off against perceived competition for light, water and nutrients with coffee. The competitiveness of trees with coffee was influenced by combinations of attributes related to: crown architecture, foliage properties and growth patterns; as well as how trees responded to management, and, their utility. Farmers consistently ranked 20 tree species for 12 attributes (five related to ecology, four to management and three to utility). Given the paucity of data on tree attributes for many species, systematically acquired and consistent local knowledge complements global scientific information and can be useful in bridging knowledge gaps relating to the integration of tree diversity in coffee production systems, which is an increasingly important strategy for smallholder farmers adapting to climate change.},

However, the dissemination of WSI in China has been slow and little is understood with respect to why farmers adopt WSI or how WSI interacts with the social and institutional contexts in which it is embedded. By analyzing qualitative data from 37 semi-structured and 56 unstructured interviews across 13 villages in northwest China, this paper examines smallholder farmers' knowledge and perceptions of WSI, and how WSI interacts with farmer livelihood decision-making and extant systems of land and water management. The results show that smallholders' willingness to adopt and continuously use WSI was dampened by (1) a lack of communal capital and measures for conflict resolution, (2) a disconnect between the temporal demands of practicing WSI and the ways farmers prioritize different livelihood strategies, (3) misconceptions about WSI systems and how they work, (4) market risks, and (5) landownership structure and economies of scale. These results suggest that programs for promoting WSI must be holistic in nature and address smallholders' day-to-day problems. Understanding why WSI did not succeed in some places will help formulate policy interventions that avoid reproducing conflicts, risks, and technological malfunctions responsible for previous failure.},

The analysis begins with a summary of the historical development of the technology of rubber cultivation, focusing of the transplanting of Para rubber from South America to South-East Asia and the construction of knowledge of rubber cultivation, both during and following this transplanting. This history of knowledge construction was characterised by two critical discontinuities, involving the separation of the rubber plant from its original conceptual context, and extensive experimentation with rubber production technologies. The resulting system as Asian smallholder cultivation is, like many other such systems, neither indigenous nor exogenous but rather hybrid in character, and representation of this hybridity is strongly contested by the principal parties involved, namely the smallholders on the one hand and on the other the government estate sector. It is concluded, first that the concept of indigenous knowledge is a type of “dividing practice”, which over-writes a history interaction and contestation and, second, that the concept of indigenous knowledge has gone through a “life cycle” of initial reception and utility followed by subsequent rejection and disutility.},

	abstract = {Disasters result from the interactions of hazards and vulnerability conditions. Considering the perspectives of survivors of a disaster event is critical for reducing the progression of vulnerability conditions. The Mbire community in Zimbabwe is facing increasing threats from recurring high- and low-magnitude floods that manifest themselves in the disruption of livelihoods and destruction of crops and infrastructure. This study, therefore, explored the perspectives of flood survivors on vulnerability to floods and examined their vulnerability-reduction measures. Using an interpretivist approach to knowledge generation, a sample of 51 research participants provided data through interviews, a focus group discussion and field observations. Results showed that shortage of land, flood-based farming practices, poverty and climate change, amongst others, are the key drivers of the smallholder farmers' vulnerability to floods. The most affected groups of people include women, children and the elderly. To reduce their vulnerability, the smallholder farmers mainly rely on traditional flood-proofed structures built on stilts, dual home system and indigenous flood forecasting. The study proposes six policy implications to reduce vulnerability to floods. These include diversifying rural livelihoods beyond the farming sector, investment in irrigation infrastructure, increasing access to financial resources, constructing human settlements away from floodplains, enforcing environmental laws regarding flood-based farming and community education on the long-term negative impacts of recession farming. The implementation of these policy recommendations can contribute to community resilience to flood disasters.},

	abstract = {The study assessed the impact of climate change adaptation strategies on technical efficiency of smallholder rice farmers in South-west Nigeria. An endogeneity corrected stochastic frontier model which account for the endogeneity of adoption of adaptation strategies that is likely to depend on inefficiency was employed for the study. The result of the study revealed that adoption of adaption strategies is endogenously determined with rice productivity and hence, failure to account for endogeneity, the parameter efficiency estimates would be inconsistent The empirical results from the model show that quantity of labour, herbicides and the interaction of labour with both farm size and insecticides were statistically significant in explaining the variations in the efficiency of rice production in the study area. In addition, the study identified the combined effects of climate change adaptation strategies and some socioeconomic characteristics such as age, gender, education, farming experience, access to credit, access to information, membership of farmers in agricultural based cooperative and location of rice farmers as sources of technical inefficiencies. The study concluded that increase implementation of climate change adaptation strategies could enhance rice productivity and technical efficiency of rice farmers through timely access to climate change information and other related institutional support. Based on farmers' knowledge and understanding of changes in climatic conditions and the adaptation strategies to mitigate its effect, it is therefore important for the government, stakeholders and donor agencies to involve farmers in the climate change adaptation planning process.

To address this, we evaluated how local knowledge and perceptions influenced decision-making processes among smallholder cocoa farmers. We conducted individual semistructured interviews with 72 cocoa farmers in Southeast Sulawesi and documented local knowledge about soil fertility indicators, nutrient cycling processes, and the interactions among shade trees, cocoa trees, and soils in cocoa agroforests. We further collected data regarding farmers' fertilizer preferences, additional income sources, and perceived barriers to improved cocoa production. We found that farmers' understanding of biophysical interactions in Southeast Sulawesi was comprehensive, mostly accurately aligned with scientific literature, and sometimes provided additional complementary knowledge. Cocoa farmers in Southeast Sulawesi approached decision making in a holistic way, integrating personal observations, information from external sources, and socioeconomic limitations and priorities. This finding highlights the value of flexible conservation farming approaches that allow farmers to minimize trade-offs and prioritize their households' needs. Finally, we identify a “dual” knowledge gap on the part of farmers and scientists regarding the direct benefits of shade tree inclusion for improved yields and income security. Addressing this through further research and targeted knowledge dissemination could contribute to an increase in the long-term adoption rates of more sustainable cocoa cultivation practices.},

Several studies predict worsening outcomes for future climate events, for example heat waves, drought and intense precipitation. Farmers are required to adopt several measures to thrive, given the observed or expected climate change events. Existing studies about the interaction between climate change the agriculture sector has focused evaluating the bi-directional causal relationships, and identifying adaptation measures, but research on the climate resilience aspect of these adaptation measures is missing, or at best, low. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by assessing resilience and contribution to sustainability of farmer-adopted measures aimed at addressing risks posed by climate change. We conduct a systematic review of 95 studies concentrating on climate adaptation by smallholder rural farmers in Nigeria in the period 2010 to 2019. We assess the climate resilience of adaptation measures using the Ifejika-Speranza Resilience Check Toolkit. Our findings show that farmers are using climate-resilient adaptation measures; however, we could not ascertain how these have led to sustainable agricultural systems, since it is not the focus of the current study. Our findings show that majority of the adaptation studies in Nigeria are focused on crop farming subsystem. The major agricultural ecosystems and the broad adaptation areas are: Crop farming (improved soil and land management, crop-specific Innovation, water management practices, climate information services and education, access to finance, and off-farm diversification), livestock farming (improved livestock management systems, improved breeding strategies, sustainable health improvement, proper feed formulation early maturing and heat-resistant bird varieties), and fish farming (water harvesting measures, organic material, quick-maturing varieties).},

The semi-arid regions of East Africa suffer under demographic pressure and soil depletion. Ecosystem degradation becomes particularly visible along rivers in semiarid regions of south-east Kenya, where former pristine riparian forests have been transformed into agricultural fields and settlements with negative effects on ecosystem services. In this study, we aim to understand how local smallholders perceive the challenges for the riparian ecosystems and what factors affect their engagement in environmental conservation. We surveyed about 200 farmers and performed expert interviews with representatives from governmental institutions from the field of land- and resource management along Nzeeu River in south-east Kenya. We assessed the level of education, land use practices, environmental knowledge, attitudes and the willingness to contribute to nature conservation. We tested for spatial bias to understand smallholders' perceptions on environmental challenges. Our data show that land division due to inheritance is not perceived as a problem by the farmers. However, owners holding{\textless}1ha of land property are less willing to spare some of their land for conservation, as opposed to those holding land plots above this size. Despite a high level of general willingness to conserve ecosystems, our data underline that local people hardly actively engage in conservation action. Furthermore, our data indicate a communication gap between local smallholders and regional governmental officers as well as overconfidence in mass media through the radio which can contradict successful adoption of pro-environment behavior. Sustainable land management in our study area is not a matter of education, but depends from the size of land property. There is an urgent need to bridge this communication gap, as a prerequisite to improve sustainable land management.},

This is due to the lack of uniformity in practices, favoring the introduction and spread of the disease. This is worsened by the lack of information on how management practices contribute to the spread of ND. The current study assessed the role of extensive chicken production systems and management practices on the frequency of ND outbreaks in Kenya using a Poisson regression model (PRM) on primary survey data from 332 farmers in Kakamega and Machakos counties. Descriptive results showed a low access to institutional support services like extension, training, credit, and vaccination services for both male and female farmers. Results from the PRM analysis show that flock size, isolated and confined housing, multi-aged flock mixture, screening of birds, access to ND vaccination, ND awareness, distance to agro-veterinary service providers, and access to animal health training and extension services had significant effects on the frequency of ND outbreaks. The findings underscore the need for innovative extension approaches that facilitate the use of information communication technologies to create more awareness on disease detection and mitigation measures. Use of farmer groups as innovation platforms for enhanced skill sharing and as key peer monitoring channels would also improve compliance with prescribed disease control methods. Further, there is a need for partnerships between local-level county governments, vaccine producers, and agro-veterinary service providers to ensure the development of low-cost vaccines and requisite storage facilities, and their timely delivery to the male and female resource-poor smallholder extensive chicken farmers.},

	abstract = {Transdisciplinary sustainability research (TDR) is characterised by methodologies that support a rich and direct interaction between academics and other societal stakeholders. However, it is not to be taken for granted that societal stakeholders are interested in collaboration, or that researchers have the skills to put participative methods into action. While there are several frameworks available to evaluate transdisciplinary research, the quality of participants' engagement is often neglected during evaluations. The aim of this paper is to empirically assess the intrinsic motivation of participating societal stakeholders to engage in TDR by pairing Self-Determination Theory with Poggi's conceptual analysis of enthusiasm. We argue that the quality of collaboration between academic and other societal stakeholders is reflected by the latter's enthusiasm to participate, and that this supports the co-creation of outputs that societal stakeholders can put into practice. Two smallholder dairy farmer groups in Nakuru County, Kenya, reflected on their engagement in a collaborative learning process (CLP) that started in 2013. The goal of the collaboration was to co-develop contextualized innovations. We found that giving more voice and increasing representation and power of farmers in the research process sparked their enthusiasm, while a sense of progress and success sustained it. The strengthened sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness associated with intrinsic motivation helped participants invest in co-creating research outputs that have direct effects on their production systems. Especially for agricultural research for development spanning between Global North and Global South contexts, sensitivity to encouraging participants' intrinsic motivation can contribute towards decolonizing research methodologies and shifting more power towards the societal stakeholders that these projects are meant to serve. We conclude that assessing participants' intrinsic motivation and enthusiasm helps to determine the quality of collaboration. A possible implication could also be the differentiation between methodological approaches employed in TDR that deeply engage societal stakeholders for knowledge integration and co-production, and those that do so only at a superficial level.},

	abstract = {Studies have determined the factors influencing agricultural drought resilience of smallholder farmers and implications for empowerment. Other than the Abbreviated Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI), studies do not provide an analysis of cultural or traditional beliefs and reflective dialogues on challenges of smallholder female livestock farmers. This study uses a mixed approach that includes a survey, A-WEAI, Pearson's chi-square coefficient, and reflective dialogue to analyze these challenges. The ability to adapt to agricultural drought is influenced by factors such as access to information, credit, productive resources, and available time, all of which are different for men and women. Our study found that 61.3\% and 16.4\% of the female and male farmers were disempowered. Domains that contributed the most to the disempowerment of the women and men were respectively time/workload (52.97\% and 31.89\%), access to and decisions on credit (17.7\% and 21.4\%), ownership of assets (11.3\% and 8.5\%), input into productive decisions (10\% and 9.1\%) and group membership (8\% and 19.13\%). No significant correlation for age, marital status, or level of education versus empowerment status of women was found. A significant correlation was observed between farming experience and the empowerment status of women. Reflective dialogue during interviews revealed that women struggled with access to finance, grazing, water, stock theft, lack of training and knowledge, and intimidation by male neighbors. Such findings help inform agricultural development strategies to develop or modify existing policies to enhance the resilience of farmers to agricultural drought and empowerment. Gender-specific agricultural projects should be encouraged to empower female farmers to improve their resilience to agricultural drought. The government should assist female livestock farmers in accessing credit and developing clear policies on land tenure issues. Mentorship programs should be encouraged to educate and support female smallholder farmers to enhance their agricultural drought resilience and empowerment.},

	volume = {3},
	doi = {10.1002/pan3.10238},
	abstract = {1. Interactions between farmers and agrobiodiversity are key drivers of agroeco-systems sustainability and of the resilience of such systems to perturbations, but research into the human/nature interactions have overlooked some important aspects of agrobiodiversity management. In particular, farmers' ecological knowledge of the spatial organisation of plant diversity remains an open question, although knowledge and practices have major implications for the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources. 2. Our study addresses this question by analysing how farmers spatially organise plant species in agroforests based on their knowledge of species interactions and interactions with the environment. The Analanjirofo region on the north-east coast of Madagascar provides an interesting context to explore this issue in clove-based agroforests, as these systems were developed by farmers as a sustainable alternative to the traditional system of shifting rice cultivation. 3. Using an emic approach, that is based on the farmers' perspective, and participatory mapping, we studied plant diversity and its spatial organisation in 17 clove-based agroforests and in 28 management sub-units defined by farmers in a village of Vavatenina district. The plant functions and farmers' knowledge of plant interactions with clove tree were recorded in semi-structured interviews, and the interactions were represented in a cognitive map. 4. Farmers manage more than 50 plant species associated with diverse functions. Analysis of participatory maps identified four main types of species association as a function of the age of the clove trees and the associated plant diversity, and different spatial organisation patterns as a function of the topography and the surrounding species. Analysis of farmers' knowledge provided valuable insights into spatial organisation practices, how farmers perceive the adaptation of plant species to biophysical heterogeneity of the environment and whether they can be associated with other species. 5. Our findings and methods pave the way for further interdisciplinary research on farmers/nature interactions to support the development of agrobiodiversity-based systems taking into account farmer and scientific knowledge and practices, especially in the tropics where the expansion of cash crops in input-intensive and mono-cropping systems has driven major disruptions to smallholder agriculture.},

	abstract = {As the sustainability of agricultural citizen science projects depends on volunteer farmers who contribute their time, energy and skills, understanding their motivation is important to attract and retain participants in citizen science projects. The objectives of this study were to assess 1) farmers' motivations to participate as citizen scientists and 2) farmers' mobile telephone usage. Building on motivational factors identified from previous citizen science studies, a questionnaire based methodology was developed which allowed the analysis of motivational factors and their relation to farmers' characteristics. The questionnaire was applied in three communities of farmers, in countries from different continents, participating as citizen scientists. We used statistical tests to compare motivational factors within and among the three countries. In addition, the relations between motivational factors and farmers characteristics were assessed. Lastly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to group farmers based on their motivations. Although there was an overlap between the types of motivations, for Indian farmers a collectivistic type of motivation (i.e., contribute to scientific research) was more important than egoistic and altruistic motivations. For Ethiopian and Honduran farmers an egoistic intrinsic type of motivation (i.e., interest in sharing information) was most important. While fun has appeared to be an important egoistic intrinsic factor to participate in other citizen science projects, the smallholder farmers involved in this research valued `passing free time' the lowest. Two major groups of farmers were distinguished: one motivated by sharing information (egoistic intrinsic), helping (altruism) and contribute to scientific research (collectivistic) and one motivated by egoistic extrinsic factors (expectation, expert interaction and community interaction). Country and education level were the two most important farmers' characteristics that explain around 20\% of the variation in farmers motivations. For educated farmers, contributing to scientific research was a more important motivation to participate as citizen scientists compared to less educated farmers. We conclude that motivations to participate in citizen science are different for smallholders in agriculture compared to other sectors. Citizen science does have high potential, but easy to use mechanisms are needed. Moreover, gamification may increase the egoistic intrinsic motivation of farmers.},

Using data on tree-crop interactions from Zimbabwe, we have used the S℡LA model to simulate the negative ecological and economic impacts of trees on crops, and the benefits of various goods and services derived from trees (soil fertility, shade, fruits, etc.). The value of trees in fields generally decreased with increased rainfall and with increased fertiliser inputs. The model only supports the extensionists' recommendations that trees should be removed from fields in the case where farmers can use high inorganic fertiliser levels, and for high rainfall regions. However, even under these conditions, 1-2 trees ha(-1) may need to be retained for the value of shade. The model further predicts intercropping with trees where fertiliser inputs are low or absent, and where rainfall is low. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The growth rate of female calves on dairy farms is one of the crucial factors which influence age at first calving, affecting lifetime lactation productivity of a dairy cow. Diets with adequate crude protein are necessary to support calf growth. The study objective was to determine the effects of nutritional advice and diet supple. mentation with Calliandra calothyrsus and Sesbania sesban on average daily weight gain in dairy calves on semicommercial smallholder dairy farms in Kenya. This trial involved 155 calves from 73 smallholder dairy farms, in Kenya, randomly selected and allocated to either intervention or control groups. The intervention group received nutritional advice and seedlings of Calliandra calothyrsus and Sesbania sesban, while the control group did not receive these interventions. Every 1-2 months for 16 months, data on farm nutritional practices and management were collected in a questionnaire, and physical examinations were done to monitor weight and health status. Descriptive and univariable statistical analyses were conducted, and multivariable mixed linear regression models were used for identification of factors associated (P {\textless} 0.05) with the natural log transformation of weight gain of calves on a given farm, controlling for clustering of visits within calves. Feeding at least 0.2 kg/day (wet weight) of Calliandra or Sesbania to calves {\textless} 6 months old resulted in 33.2\% increase in daily weight gain, while controlling for confounding by breed and sex of the calf. For calves a {\textgreater}= 6 months, there was a significant interaction between amount of hay fed and if calves were also fed on Calliandra or Sesbania. When no Calliandra or Sesbania supplementation was provided, the mean weight gain was low and relatively constant even with increasing amounts of hay. When Calliandra or Sesbania supplement was added to the diet, the mean weight gain increased from 0.17 kg to 0.48 kg when hay was fed at 1 and 5 kg, respectively, while controlling for confounding by amount of maize silage fed and the prevailing season. In conclusion, supplementation of calf diets with at least 0.2 kg/calf/day of Calliandra or Sesbania is beneficial for faster weight gains.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of the revolving fund (RF) regarding the ability of smallholder debtors to retrieve land title deeds, and also to examine the factors influencing the outstanding debts and percentage of outstanding interest of the smallholders in the Central and Northeastern regions of Thailand. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data were collected from 430 debtors in the Central and Northeastern regions of Thailand in order to compare the differences in livelihood assets as well as their opinions on benefits derived from the operation of the RF. Secondary data were also collected from the RF administration, in order to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the fund. Heteroskedasticity-corrected ordinary least squares and Tobit regression models were employed to examine the factors influencing the outstanding debts and percentage of outstanding interest of the smallholders, respectively. Furthermore, the student's/-test was used to examine the differences in the livelihood assets among debtors in the two regions; and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine differences in livelihood indicator scores among the three types of debtors. Findings - The empirical results revealed that the RF is effective as the fund could provide loan to smallholders to enable them redeem their land title deeds from their previous creditors. The/-test results reveal significant differences in the livelihood assets among debtors in the two regions. One-way ANOVA indicates differences in livelihood indicator scores among the three types of debtors. The results of the heteroskedasticity-corrected ordinary least squares regression revealed that being married, low frequency of floods and less influence of third parties significantly reduced the outstanding debts. The results of the censored Tobit regression revealed that increased frequency of meeting with the RF administration, less influence of third parties, high land potential and interaction of age and experience significantly decreased the percentage of outstanding interest. Practical implications - It is imperative to intensify information and education regarding the regulations, payment terms and modalities to clients in order to facilitate repayments of the loans disbursed. The organization of the RF should pay particular attention to the role of the committees involved, information administration and loan repayment monitoring. The RF should increase the frequency of meetings with smallholders, minimize the influence of third parties and give priority to old and experienced smallholders who possess land with high potential for earning incomes to enable them repay the loans. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that examined the effectiveness of the RF to enable smallholders retrieve their land title deeds.},

At two research sites, each method produced markedly different results. Drawing on the work of feminist political ecologists and other geographers, we suggest that the dissonance between data sets generated using different research methods arises because each method produces knowledge that is partial and situated. To explain the contradictions between smallholder perceptions of climate change across the qualitative and quantitative methods and their disagreement with the climate record, we adopt aspects of assemblage theory and the dwelling perspective to suggest that smallholder knowledge of climate change is structured through their observations of and interactions with dynamic, networked socio-natural assemblages. We argue that a better understanding of the conduits through which perceptions and experiences of climate change come into being, and hence how climate knowledge is shaped, is necessary to account for the multiple epistemologies through which climate change is known.},

	abstract = {Effective responses to the impacts of climate change require the recognition that people conceptualize and experience environmental changes differently, and require the support of a range of global-to-local interdisciplinary efforts that allow a dialog between the biophysical and social sciences. In this study, we use a hybrid epistemological framework that integrates scientifc and local knowledge systems, methodological approaches, and geographic scopes to: 1) shed light on climate change in the equatorial Andes as reported by scientific and local knowledge systems, and 2) understand the role that climate factors play on land use and agricultural change in natural resource dependent communities in the region. We analyzed weather station (n = 5) data and downscaled climate data using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, and spatial analysis techniques to detect spatio-temporal climate trends between 1965 and 2013. We also analyzed climate variability in the past four decades using qualitative information derived from a semi-structured survey (n = 36) and life history smallholder interviews (n = 8) collected in three research sites. Our study reveals significant warming trends in the region which is corroborated by local reports. Precipitation records show high inter-annual variability, with no significant decreasing or increasing trends, which contradicts people's views in two of our research sites. Our study shows that although climate change appears to be a factor that influences farmers' agricultural and livestock-production practices, other non-climatic forces play a more important role in determining their intensity and adoption. Despite site-level divergences and convergences, scientific and local knowledge systems can be woven together to expand our understanding of the physical and human manifestations of climate change.

We found that farmer high/low categorization of soils corresponded to soil P fertility and distance from farmer dwellings. Measures of soil P fertility also were inversely related to mycorrhizal colonization of vetch roots and directly related to the potential for P release by legume residues (C:P ratio). However, particular soil properties (texture and calcium phosphate pools) were better in explaining the response of legume biological nitrogen fixation to P addition, with maximal impacts in low-clay soils and soils with low calcium phosphates, as assessed with a dilute HCl extraction. In these conducive contexts, legume BNF increased 67 and 150\% for RP and TSP, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), with similar increases in biomass P stocks that showed promise for soil regeneration. In low-P fields, added P increased potential P release from legume residues via lower C:P ratios (p {\textless} 0.05). Percent cover of soil increased from 35\% in the control to 45 and 55\% with RP and TSP (p {\textless} 0.05), which shows potential for reduced erosion risk under P fertilization of legumes.

	abstract = {The challenges of land degradation, climate change and food insecurity have led to the introduction of conservation agriculture (CA) aimed at enhancing yield and soil quality. Despite positive biophysical results, low adoption rates have been the focus of studies identifying constraints to wider uptake. While the adoption framework is popular for measuring agricultural innovation, objective adoption measurements remain problematic and do not recognize the contextual and dynamic decision-making process. This study uses a technographic and participatory approach to move beyond the adoption framework and understand: (a) how agricultural decision-making takes place including the knowledge construction, (b) how agriculture is performed in a context of project intervention and (c) how practice adaptation plays out in the context of interacting knowledge. Findings confirm that farmer decision-making is dynamic, multidimensional and contextual. The common innovation diffusion model uses a theory of change, showcasing benefits through training lead farmers as community advocates and demonstration trials. Our study shows that the assumed model of technology transfer with reference to climate-smart agriculture interventions is not as linear and effective as assumed previously. We introduce four lenses that contribute to better understanding complex innovation dynamics: (a) social dynamics and information transfer, (b) contextual costs and benefits, (c) experience and risk aversion, and (d) practice adaptation. Investments should build on existing knowledge and farming systems including a focus on the dynamic decision process to support the `scaling up, scaling out and scaling deep' agenda for sustainable agricultural innovations.},

The role of the smallholder farmer community in soil fertility evaluation and management was examined from two `research for development' projects in northern Tanzania. These are the African Highlands Initiative (AHI) and the Soil Water Management Research Group (SWMRG). Participatory approaches were applied by both projects. Fanners' experience and knowledge of local indicators of soil quality were used in identifying soil fertility constraints and in generating resource flow maps. The farmers' evaluation of soil fertility was compared with soil analytical data and with calculations of maize yields by the model QUEFTS. Farmers' indigenous knowledge in soil fertility evaluation mostly agreed with laboratory analysis and model calculations by QUEFTS. Model calculations identified potassium as the most limiting nutrient in the highlands in northeastern Tanzania for yields less than 3 t ha(-1) and phosphorus for yields higher than 4 t ha(-1). In Maswa (Lake Victoria Basin) nitrogen Was most limiting. Given that farmers' evaluation of soil fertility is relative to what they see around them, there is a need to verify their observations, but also the interpretation of laboratory data by models like QUEFTS requires continuous and critical validation. Both projects have shown that there is scope to reverse the trends of declining soil fertility in smallholder farms in northern Tanzania. Essential was that the interaction with scientists has built confidence in the farmers because their knowledge in addressing soil fertility constraints was recognized. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Field data on current crop postharvest management practices and perceptions from smallholder farming communities in an increasingly variable climate are scarce. Our study used a multi-dimensional approach to explore the practices and perceptions of these communities and their service-providers regarding grain postharvest management in semi-arid Mbire and Hwedza districts in Zimbabwe. A total of 601 individual household interviews, six focus group discussions with women and men, and interviews with 40 district stakeholders and 53 community key informants were conducted. Farmers and service-providers explained how climate change was threatening food security; causing reduced and more variable maize and sorghum yields of below 0.5 t/ha, alongside higher grain storage insect pest pressure. Increased food insecurity and concerns regarding grain theft have driven a shift from bulk storage in traditional outdoor free-standing granaries to polypropylene bags stacked inside the living quarters. Poor and improper use of synthetic pesticides in these circumstances exacerbates the health-related risks. Agricultural extension officers were the most common source of agronomic and postharvest information followed by farmer-to-farmer information exchange. Targeted postharvest training; participatory field trials involving agricultural extension staff, farmers and other service-providers; and policy dialogue around grain postharvest management and food security are proposed to help in strengthening the capacity to reduce grain postharvest losses under increasingly unpredictable conditions.},

The study involved a sample survey of farmers, and in-depth interviews with farmers, extension officers and other government staff, and leaders of farmer associations. This particular paper explores two themes that emerged in the course of the larger study: first, what is popularly known in South Africa and elsewhere as the culture of dependency and entitlement, and second, the forms of support that government chooses to offer to small-scale farmers. The paper argues that government is stuck in a vicious cycle whereby it seeks to placate expectant small-scale farmers with material support, which it can most effectively do via problematic group projects; although generally ineffective, the practice has the effect of maintaining widespread demand for such support, even to the point that small-scale farmers form group projects for the sole purpose of attracting it. In seeking to compensate for the weaknesses of this approach, government has sought to introduce compensatory measures such as strategic partnerships, sometimes with the ironic consequence that small-scale farmers no longer play a role in farming in their agricultural projects. The paper concludes that the government in the Eastern Cape needs to return to the basics of effective extension support aimed at supporting individual farmers; to the extent material support is still needed, it should no longer be given away for free.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10460-010-9264-z},
	abstract = {It is widely recognized that mineral fertilizers must play an important part in improving agricultural productivity in western Kenyan farming systems. This paper suggests that for this goal to be realized, farmers' knowledge must be strengthened to improve their understanding of fertilizers and their use. We analyzed smallholder knowledge of fertilizers and nutrient management, and draw practical lessons from empirical collective fertilizer-response experiments. Data were gathered from the collective fertilizer-response trials, through focus group discussions, by participant observation, and via in-depth interviews representing 40 households. The collective trials showed that the application of nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) alone was insufficient to enhance yields in the study area. The response to P on the trial plots was mainly influenced by incidences of the parasitic Striga weed, by spatial variability or gradients in soil fertility of the experimental plots, and by interactions with N levels. These results inspired farmer to design and conduct experiments to compare crop performance with and without fertilizer, and between types of fertilizers, or responses on different soils. Participating farmers were able to differentiate types of fertilizer, and understood rates of application and the roles of respective fertilizers in nutrient supply. However, notions were broadly generated by unsteady yield responses when fertilizers were used across different fertility gradients, association with high cost (especially if recommended rates were to be applied), association of fertilizer use with hybrids and certain crops, historical factors, among other main aspects. We identified that strengthening fertilizer knowledge must be tailored within existing, albeit imperfect, systems of crop and animal husbandry. Farmers' perceptions cannot be changed by promoting more fertilizer use alone, but may require a more basic approach that, for example, encourages farmer experimentation and practices to enhance soil properties such as carbon build-up in impoverished local soils.},

	abstract = {Calf growth is an important determinant of dairy herd productivity, particularly in countries where the dairy industry is expanding, such as Kenya. Our objective was to determine factors associated with weight gain in randomly selected dairy calves and heifers in smallholder dairy farms (SDF) in Kenya. A cross-sectional study on a census of 321 calves and heifers (dairy calves and heifers up to 36 months of age), sampled from 200 randomly selected SDF in Naari, Kenya, formed the study population. Youngstock management was recorded using a questionnaire. Biodata were obtained through subsequent physical examination and heart girth measurement. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted, and mixed model regression was used for identification of factors associated (p {\textless} 0.05) with the natural log transformation of estimated average daily weight gain (ADG). Median and mean ADG of the youngstock were 360 and 443 (s.d. = 375) g day(-1), respectively. In the final model, ADG was highest in pre-weaned calves and declined with age. Supplementing with quality hay during the dry season at least weekly was associated with increased ADG. There was an interaction between breed and historical disease on ADG such that disease was associated with decreased ADG in Bos taurus breeds, while ADG in Bos indicus breeds was not affected by disease. There was a significant interaction between education levels of the husband and wife caretakers; when the man's education was low (having less than or equal to primary school), ADG was highest when the woman had not completed primary school, but was lower when the woman had completed primary, secondary or tertiary education, possibly because such women worked off-farm more often. General growth performance of animals on these farms was lower than benchmarked standards recommended for optimum dairy production but within previously reported ranges for the East African region. Supplementation of diets (with hay and/or concentrates) is recommended for optimum growth in calves and heifers, especially in the dry season. If nutritional management of Bos taurus youngstock is not improved, crosses of Bos indicus could be better suited for the current nutritional management systems in SDF in Meru having calf disease problems. Interventions to support educating women (the primary caretakers of the cattle) and men in the community on calf management should be initiated, preferably with shared on-farm responsibilities. Training in better management, even for learned farmers, would be critical to better calf growth.},

	issn = {0002-1466},
	doi = {10.1108/AFR-11-2015-0050},
	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the most recent scientific literature on the determinants explaining the demand for index-insurance, the impact of index-insurance and the existing links between insurance and credit. In this meta-analysis, the authors identify key discoveries on the potential of index-insurance in enhancing credit supply for smallholders and thus farm productivity. Design/methodology/approach - Following a systematic literature search in Scopus and Web of Science, relevant empirical articles were identified by using the following criteria search algorithm: “insurance” and (”weather” or “micro” or “area? based” or “rain*” or “livestock” or “index”), and ((”empiric*” or “experiment” or “trial” or “RCT” or “impact”) or (”credit” or “loan*” or “debt” or “finance”)). The authors identified 1,133 related papers, 110 of which were selected as closely matching the study criteria. After removing duplicates and analysing each document, 45 papers were included in the current analysis. The framework for addressing insurance and credit issues, in the paper, entails three subsequent themes, namely, adoption of insurance, impact of insurance and links between insurance and credit. Findings - It is not confirmed yet that demand for insurance is indeed hump-shaped in risk aversion and the functional form of this relationship should be tested in more detail. This also holds for the magnitude of the effect of trust and education on actual demand. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent other risk mitigation strategies form complements or substitutes to index-insurance. Lastly, the interaction between basis risk and price is important to the design of index-insurance products. If basis risk and price elasticity are indeed highly correlated, products that diminish basis risk are crucial in increasing demand. On the impact of bundled products, e.g. combination of insurance and credit, limited empirical research has been conducted. For example, it is unknown to what extent credit suppliers would react to the insured status of farmers or what the preferences of farmers are when it comes to a mix of financial products. In addition, several researchers have suggested that microfinance institutions or banks could insure themselves against covariate risk, yet no empirical evidence about this insurance mechanism has been conducted so far. Research limitations/implications - The authors based the research on scientific literature uploaded in Scopus and Web of Science. Other potentially insightful grey literature was not included due to lack of accessibility. Given the research findings, there is plenty of opportunity for further research particularly with regard to the effects of bundled products, e.g. insurance plus credit, on demand for index-insurance, supply of credit, loan conditions and impact on farm productivity and farmers' well-being. Practical implications - Microfinance institutions, insurance companies, NGOs, research institutions and universities, particularly in developing countries, will be interested to learn about the systematic review of scientific research done in the area of insurance and credit for agriculture and the possibilities for application in their own practice of supplying these financial products. Social implications - A rigorous understanding of the potential of index-insurance and credit is essential for identifying the right mix of financial products that help smallholder farmers to increase farm productivity and their own well-being. Originality/value - The paper is valuable due to its rigorous evaluation of existing theoretical and empirical research around issues explaining the degree of adoption and impact of index-insurance and that of bundled financial products (i.e. index-insurance plus credit). The paper has the potential to become essential reading for academics, practitioners and policy-makers interested in researching and putting in practice the best options leading to greater farm productivity and well-being in developing countries.},

Widespread mobile phone ownership in Africa means that, for the first time, there is a realistic opportunity to deliver pertinent information to remote farmers throughout the continent. Efforts to harness the potential of mobile phones include the development of agricultural market information services (MIS) - applications that send farmers crop pricing information via short message service or SMS. These services promote economic development among some farmers in the developing world, but not yet in rural Kenya. To understand what factors impede the adoption of these services, we qualitatively studied Kenyan farmers' mobile phone usage patterns and their interactions with MFarm, a commercially available MIS. Using affordance theory to guide our analysis, we discovered a mismatch between the design of MIS and smallholder farmers' perceptions of their mobile phones' communication capabilities. We use these findings to motivate a design agenda that encourages software developers and development practitioners to adopt an ecological perspective when creating mobile applications for sub-Saharan Africa's rural farmers. Strategies for implementing this approach include reconsidering the design of mobile phones, and developing innovative educational interventions.},

This paper assesses the role of economic, social, political and organizational processes on technology adoption in smallholder livestock production systems based on innovation systems perspective. Functions of the innovation systems framework was used to assess the missing links in the dairy sector value chains. The results show that weak or missing innovation systems functions such as entrepreneurship, knowledge diffusion, market development, and policy advocacy mirror the low uptake of improved technologies in the livestock sector. Shortage of domestic suppliers of key technological inputs and services, weak input and output markets and weak interaction among value chain actors have been the major hindrances to livestock development. For example, there were no reliable sources of improved breeds of dairy heifers, veterinary supplies, quality semen, and equipment. The results suggest that technical knowledge and availability of economic opportunities alone may not be enough to stimulate the uptake of technologies and commercialization of dairy production. The peculiar nature of inputs, services, and output in the livestock sector requires innovative business models that can facilitate the coordination of knowledge, skills, inputs, services and output markets in livestock value chains.},

We reviewed existing theories and frameworks for the uptake of agricultural innovations and found that these tend to emphasize the role of extrinsic factors such as the characteristics of the adopter and the external environment in the decision-making process. In this paper, we argue that intrinsic factors such as the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of the potential adopter towards the innovation play a key role, but this has been less studied. We present an analytical framework that combines both extrinsic and intrinsic factors in farmers' decisions to adopt new agricultural technologies and apply the framework to agroforestry adoption as a case study. We review the literature on agroforestry adoption in sub-Saharan Africa and identify the extrinsic and intrinsic variables affecting the uptake of agroforestry technologies. We conclude that the uptake of agricultural technologies is a complex process influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic variables, and recommend that future studies aiming to understand the adoption process of agricultural innovations take into account both sets of variables. A mechanistic understanding of how intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact and drive adoption can help in targeting technologies appropriately to ensure sustainability.},

	doi = {10.17159/sajs.2020/4649},
	abstract = {The ability of smallholder farmers to utilise seasonal climate forecast (SCF) information in farm planning to reflect anticipated climate is a precursor to improved farm management. However, the integration of SCF by smallholder farmers into farm planning has been poor, partly because of the lack of forecast skill, lack of communication and inability to see the relevance of the SCFs for specific farming decisions. The relevance of seasonal climate forecasting in farming decisions can be enhanced through improved understanding of SCF from the smallholder farmers' perspective. Studies that have been done of how smallholder farmers understand SCF and how the available SCFs influence smallholder farmers' decisions are limited. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to review how smallholder farmers make decisions on farming practices based on SCFs and the challenges and opportunities thereof. The review shows that the majority of smallholder farmers in Africa make use of either scientific or indigenous knowledge climate forecasts and, in some cases, a combination of both. There are mixed results in the area of evaluating benefits of SCFs in decision-making and farm production. In some cases, the outcomes are positive, whereas in others they are difficult to quantify. Thus, the integration of SCFs into smallholder farmers' decision-making is still a challenge. We recommend that significant work must be done to improve climate forecasts in terms of format, and spatial and temporal context in order for them to be more useful in influencing decision-making by smallholder farmers. Significance: At the farm level, making the right decisions at the right time is rendered even more difficult in light of the increasing frequency of extreme weather patterns. The threat of climate change makes accurate seasonal climate forecasting essential for African smallholder farmers. Technological, social and interdisciplinary issues, communication and scale are some key challenges which impact the utility and uptake of SCFs in rural smallholder farms. The integration of both scientific and indigenous knowledge forecasts is an opportunity for further exploration.},

Prior knowledge about community vulnerability levels is crucial to minimizing potential losses from future threats. Most vulnerability studies focus on high-impact disasters and their temporal and spatial analyses. Yet high-frequency, low-impact disasters have a cumulative potential to severely disrupt or damage socioeconomic systems. There is limited knowledge especially in the global south about the creation of vulnerability to hydrometeorological threats. Using a systems approach, this study explores ways in which communities in the northern semiarid tropics of Zimbabwe are vulnerable to hydrometeorological threats. This predominantly qualitative study used literature review, interviews, transect walks, and focus groups to gather data from selected samples involving smallholder farmers with in-depth knowledge about community vulnerability. The results show that the communities are vulnerable to multiple hydrometeorological threats due to multiple interacting factors including rainfed and flood-based farming, land tenure, topography, climate, and other socioeconomic conditions such as inadequate income sources and high poverty. In order to reduce vulnerability, this study provides five policy options for government and nongovernmental organization interventions, including the need to transform rural economies beyond the traditional rainfed and flood-based farming systems.},

This study, which explored the factors that determine adoption and extent of farmers' use of the three principles of CA (i.e., minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with crop residues, and crop rotations), was conducted in 10 target communities in 8 extension planning areas in Malawi. The primary data was collected using structured questionnaires administered to individual households. Triangulation with key informant interviews, field observations, and interactive discussions with farmers and farmer groups provided information behind contextual issues underpinning the statistical inferences. From a total of 15,854 households in the study areas, it is estimated that 18\% of the smallholder farmers had adopted CA, representing an area of about 678 ha (1,675 ac; 2.1\% of all cultivated land). Land area under CA constituted about 30\% of total cultivated land among adopters. A random sample of 151 adopters and 149 nonadopters proportional with respect to adoption rates was drawn from various communities and interviewed using structured questionnaires. A total of 30 key informant interviews were conducted with stakeholders including staff of Total Land Care, government extension workers, agroinput suppliers, and lead farmers. The first stage of the Heckman model showed that hired labor, area of land cultivated, membership to farmer group, and district influenced farmers' decisions to adopt CA. The second stage of Heckman model results suggested that total cultivated land, duration of practicing CA, and district influenced farmers' decisions to extend their land to CA. Our study can be used to show the agency and social structures that are likely to influence adoption and extent of CA. Future policy should address ways to provide access to information and long-term support to farmers to enable them to embrace the technology fully.},

A total of 384 soil samples were selected from representative farmers' fields and analysed for soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and quality, as well as nutrient contents, using midDRIFTS (mid-infrared diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy) and wet chemistry analyses. MidDRIFTS was also used to calculate SOC stability indexes as SOC quality proxies. `Market distance' and `farm typology' were key determinants of soil fertility variability, both with contrasting trends in Bushumba and Mushinga. Decreasing soil fertility with increasing market distance was noted across all farm typologies. `Farm typology' was related to exchangeable calcium and magnesium, while `site' resulted in a difference of plant available phosphorus. SOC quality indexes were related to `site', interacting with `market distance'. A `market distance' effect became obvious in the medium wealthy and poor farms of Mushinga, where a lower SOC quality in remote fields plots was noted with increasing market distance. In agreement with farmers' indigenous knowledge, soil fertility levels were higher in deep than shallow soils, which were reflected in higher nutrient stocks in deep soils receiving organic amendments. Our results inferred that soil fertility variability across smallholder farms must consider various inter-related determinants as basis for site-specific fertility management interventions.},

	abstract = {Participatory Plant Breeding (PPB) is mostly considered relevant to smallholder agriculture in developing countries. PPB involves getting farmers to participate in plant breeding to overcome shortcomings in the formal plant breeding system. The potato breeding system in the Netherlands has a long standing tradition of farmer participation in breeding. This PPB differs from the `standard' PPB model as there is substantial private sector involvement and the system is situated in a modern, western context. Since its inception, farmer-breeders have contributed substantially to developing this potato breeding system, which supplies a large diversity of crop varieties that are grown in very varied environmental conditions around the world and for different consumer markets. This paper describes the current organizational structure and practices, provides some historical background and analyses the functions, relations and interactions of the major actors in the system. It argues that a historically international and commercially orientated potato sector was able to prosper because of a supportive political and legal context, which provided public institutional support to private sector potato breeding activities. Farmers' knowledge and skills are particularly well expressed and vital in breeding in potato-a very heterogeneous and vegetatively-propagated crop. A new PPB initiative called BioImpuls recently emerged and engages organic potato farmers in a search to develop late blight-resistant varieties for the organic sector. This supports the argument that farmers' knowledge can substantially contribute to modern and diversified breeding. While Dutch potato breeding is a special case in various respects, our analysis identifies several key attributes which could inform the design of successful PPB programmes in developing countries.},

	abstract = {Driven by the rapid adoption of Internet-based technologies amongst producers in the Global South, the question of how and whether global value chain arrangements are reconfigured remains open to debate. This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production.},

	abstract = {The rubber boom across much of Southeast Asia has led to environmental destruction, and the resultant crash in the price of rubber has destabilised livelihoods. We investigated the necessary factors required to enable a transition towards a more sustainable model for rubber cultivation in Southwest China (i.e. the `greening' of rubber cultivation), using a framework for the integrative study of multiple aspects in complex land use issues. We present findings from stakeholder interviews and a stakeholder workshop, and discuss their relevance Within and beyond Southwest China, The current focus of researchers and development practitioners tends to be on finding technical solutions to address unsustainable rubber cultivation practices. However, stakeholder consultations revealed that the key barriers were more social: low levers of trust and knowledge exchange between stakeholder groups and fragmented visions about the future of the landscape. It is very important to continue the economic prosperity initially brnught by rubber, but, without improved communication between government and researchers and smallholder farmers, this will be very difficult to achieve. A wider landscape perspective is needed to address issues in rubber cultivation to avoid repeating the same problems of cash crop boom and bust experienced with other crops, most notably bananas. We Conclude that more effort should be put into developing mechanisms that integrate technical knowledge, enhance social relationships, and present a forum for reconciling or at least acknowledging the differing needs, knowledge, and objectives of different groups, and transcending the power dynamics between smallholder farmers and government and researchers.

	abstract = {The concept of an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy is explored using case-study evidence from smallholder agriculture in southern Malawi. The conventional concept of strategy as a `plan' is contrasted with the use of strategy as a game, as a performance, and as an accident. This pluralistic view is echoed in recent literature on business strategy. A typology is developed that relates farmers' choice of IPM strategy to the predictability of crop losses, the stability of the crop environment, and farmers' knowledge of pests. Some implications for IPM are explored. Where conditions favour `adaptive' rather than planned IPM strategies, formal experimentation to verify farmers' strategies may be an inefficient use of resources. Where the crop environment is volatile and several pests attack the crop simultaneously, there may be limited scope to increase the adoption of IPM strategies by improving farmer knowledge of pest biology. Addressing the interactions between pest and crop management is critical in making IPM relevant for resource-poor farmers. A deeper understanding of farmers' management strategies is required to frame meaningful recommendations.},

The link between these characteristics and livelihood constraints and strategies, capital assets and the role of communication is emphasised. Although the agroforestry innovation-decision process occurs in the absence of external intervention, by understanding the characteristics of adoptable innovations in the context of adoption behaviour, it may be possible to identify new roles for extensionists and scientists. They may be able to facilitate PTD through the identification of innovators and their innovations, optimise and adapt innovations with reference to the proposed model, and disseminate innovations to other smallholders who may benefit from them.},

In Tanzania, medium-scale farms are more likely to use modern techniques and inputs and to market their output, suggesting a potential for spillover effects for their smaller-scale neighbors-particularly if they attract local agribusiness investments. We consider the population of small-scale farms in Tanzania and ask whether agricultural behaviors and outcomes are affected by the local prevalence of medium-scale farms. Using pooled OLS and household fixed-effects models, we find evidence that small-scale farms are more likely to use improved seed, to cultivate more of their landholdings, and to receive agricultural extension in the presence of more medium-scale farms. This points to positive synergies from mixed scales of farming in a given locality.},

To maintain crop production, farmers used inorganic fertilizers and a variety of locally-derived fertilizers: manure, termitarium soil, crop residues, woodland litter, compost and household waste. On average, locally-derived fertilizers provide about 25 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 65 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for fields and gardens, respectively, indicating the importance of gardens as a focus for soil management. Farmers achieve target yields without the high application rates recommended by the extension service, probably because of the positive interactive effects of applying inorganic and organic fertilizer. Current yields on these nutrient-poor sands cannot be maintained in the absence of the inorganic inputs, thus sustainability is threatened by rising human populations and the recent massive increases in fertilizer prices.},

	abstract = {The major concern of most African countries, including Nigeria, in recent times is how to increase food production because of food insecurity issues, which by extension, is a major contributing factor to the prevalence of poverty. Therefore, adoption of conservation agricultural practices is regarded as a pathway to drive the achievement of food and nutrition security, as well as the needed optimal performance in the agri-food sector. Reportedly, scaling up of the limited adoption of these practices could be facilitated through kinship ties, peer influence, and social networks that govern mutual interactions among individuals; therefore, this motivated the study. Using cross-sectional data obtained from 350 sample units selected from South-Western Nigeria through a multistage sampling technique, this study applied descriptive statistical tools and cross-tabulation techniques to profile the sampled subjects while count outcome models were used to investigate the factors driving counts of conservative agriculture (CA) adoption. Similarly, a marginal treatment effects (MTEs) model (parametric approach) using local IV estimator was applied to examine the effects of CA adoption on the outcome (log of farmers' farm income). Additionally, appropriate measures of fit tests statistics were used to test the reliabilities of the fitted models. Findings revealed that farmers' years of farming experience (p {\textless} 0.1), frequency of extension visits (p {\textless} 0.05), and social capital viz-a-viz density of social group memberships (p {\textless} 0.05) significantly determined the count of CA practices adopted with varying degrees by smallholder farmers. Although, social capital expressed in terms of membership of occupational group and diversity of social group members also had a positive influence on the count of CA practices adopted but not significant owing largely to the information gaps about agricultural technologies in the study area. However, the statistical tests of the MTEs indicated that the treatment effects differed significantly across the covariates and it also varied significantly with unobserved heterogeneity. The policy relevant treatment effect estimates also revealed that different policy scenarios could increase or decrease CA adoption, depending on which individuals it induces to attract the expected spread and exposure.},

Agroecology is a broad concept considered to have transformative potential, yet as a research field it has often been technology-centred and focused at the local level. Building on the experiences of Ugandan agroecologists working in an array of agricultural professions throughout the country, this paper identifies and discusses major barriers to agroecology in Uganda. Inductive analysis of qualitative data from interviews and focus groups generated four types of interacting barriers; constraints at farmer level, an agricultural knowledge system favouring conventional approaches, adverse and intertwined political and economic interests, and cross-cutting ideological and discursive pressures. These broad challenges become manifest in the accounts presented, making clear that barriers to and therefore also appropriate strategies for advancing agroecology must be treated as contextual even if a global movement' is emerging around it. The discussion suggests theoretical lenses for further inquiry into agroecology and its realization in light of these constraints.},

However, farmers' awareness on the food safety risk is limited, affecting their on-farm activities. Thus, this study was conducted to assess and compare the farmers' perceptions on food safety issues and risks caused by the management and practices at layer farms. Design/methodology/approach Farmers from 143 farms certified by National Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) standard and 59 non-GAP farms were interviewed using a structured questionnaire for risk perception evaluation. Their level of perceived risk was compared using a scoring system. Findings The food safety hazards in eggs seem to be fairly recognized by both groups of farmers. GAP farmers demonstrated a higher risk of food safety incidences caused by inappropriate management and practices in farms than non-GAP farmers (p {\textless} 0.001). Although the results did not confirm the strong connection between risk perception and risk reduction behavior, these findings are beneficial to the food safety policy implementers to evaluate the critical issues for risk communication and for knowledge dissemination activities. The influence of other internal and external factors on farmers' food safety-related behavior should be further investigated. Research limitations/implications The impact limitation was identified due to the restriction of scope on a specific population and region. The target respondents did not cover all scales, especially the backyard and smallholder farmers nor other rearing systems, such as free-range productions. Originality/value The knowledge regarding the food safety practices by egg producing farmers in Thailand is limited. Notably, this study contributes to the literature in elucidating the preventive behavior of food handlers and all stakeholders in the Thai food supply chain. The implementations of food safety preventive measures by two groups of farmers, GAP-certified and non-GAP-certified farmers, will guide policymakers to intervene more successfully regarding the appropriate changes needed.},

	abstract = {Oil palm is an important industrial, livelihood and food crop in Ghana. Smallholders produce the bulk of the palm fruits and small-scale processors, mainly women, produce most of the crude palm oil. Poor practices lead to a high proportion of free fatty acids in the crude palm oil and the processors thus cannot access remunerative national and international markets. Exploratory and diagnostic studies identified the absence of rules and regulations governing processing as a major factor. An innovation platform was convened and facilitated to remove the identified institutional constraints. Based on event tracing, this paper reports a study of the effects of the innovation platform's interventions and how these were achieved. Institutional entrepreneurs are shown to play important roles: they mobilised resources such as expertise, knowledge, access to information and high-level political power to influence small-scale processors to adopt alternative practices. The institutional changes observed are shown to arise in cooperation between traditional authorities (chiefs), the district legislature and authorities at the national level, who together institutionalised the experimental actions and processes taken in the study area. The institutional elements they most affected were: rules and regulations, the legitimacy of new practices and organisational arrangements, co-generation of knowledge, material resources, and the strategic and communication skills of key actors.},

Documenting and recognizing this is important for the development of national agricultural ICT policies, as well as programmes aimed at increasing farmers' knowledge and use of ICT for agricultural marketing.

As there are significant differences in economic development, natural resources and agricultural productivity within the region, we estimate the Livelihood Vulnerability Index in two districts (Vaishali, Bihar and Karnal, Haryana) to determine suitable adaptation strategies under diverse conditions. To reflect different aspects of climate exposure, we include both self-reported climate shocks and spatially interpolated weather data. The assessment of 1127 households shows that while both districts have similar exposure and adaptive capacity levels, the sensitivity dimension makes Vaishali more vulnerable to climate change. To reduce sensitivity, decision-makers should focus on improving infrastructure (e.g., permanent housing, latrines, health centers, alternative energy sources). To improve adaptive capacity and reduce climate risk in both regions, policymakers should promote the expansion of extension training for livelihood diversification, information and communication technologies as well as conservation agriculture.},

	abstract = {Nigeria is endowed with underground and surface water reserves, rich pastures and favourable agroecological conditions in the country's low-lying plains with alluvial deposits, popularly referred to as fadama lands. The 3,000,000ha of fertile soils with residual moisture offer attractive opportunities for the arable farmers to grow both season and off-season high-value crops. The potential and importance of fadama agriculture for food production and economic development is crucial, given rising food prices, climatic changes, environmental risks associated with `modern' agriculture, modelled farming systems and population growth. Fadama areas are therefore of critical importance to the survival and economic development of millions of rural dwellers. This research surveys and analyses the sustainability of fadama farming systems in semi-arid northern Nigeria. Findings reveal a delicate interaction and negotiation across the formal and informal boundaries where traditional agricultural practices, based on an understanding of the particular physical reality and exploitation of natural synergies, are combined with inputs typical of conventional agriculture. African agriculture thus stands poised at a crossroads: whether to abandon tradition in favour of entirely `modern' methods and export markets as often advocated in certain circles or to depend on time-tested indigenous knowledge systems and grassroots-defined development vision which combines popular livelihoods with respect for nature's systems.},

	abstract = {This paper explores how Climate-resiliency Field Schools involving smallholder farmers in the Mindanao region of the Philippines advance climate-smart farming practices. Using data from field observations, 86 interviews, and 13 focus group discussions from five municipalities, the research finds that cross-scale activities, including local plans and multi-stakeholder forums, and municipal budgeting processes, influence adaptation and mitigation to climate change in smallholder farming systems. Furthermore, using matrix analysis and stakeholder responses, we identify interactions, synergies, conflicts, and potential co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation, and food production practices. The analysis of climate-resiliency field school practices shows that the addition of livelihood outcomes to smallholder farming landscapes strengthen adaptation, mitigation, and food production outcomes (and vice versa). Climate-resiliency Field Schools have promoted the practice of organic farming, various systems for rice intensification, and the establishment of community seed banks. Other practices, such as soil conservation, reforestation, and agroforestry, have been used in Mindanao to maintain carbon stocks while increasing crop production. Climate-resiliency Field Schools serve as a multilevel institutional platform where farmers can access climate information, which they can use to improve farm planning (i.e., choices of crops, timing of farm preparation, and harvest). The research findings suggest that climate-smart interventions are highly location-specific, technically rigorous, involve knowledge-intensive processes, and are influenced by the knowledge and capacities of local farming communities and implementing partners. We conclude with some suggestions for the design of programs, and the types of interventions that are required to sustain and ultimately scale up efforts to enhance climate-smart agriculture.

	abstract = {Animal pollination is responsible for the majority of the human food supply. Understanding pollination dynamics in agricultural systems is thus essential to help maintain this ecosystem service in the face of human disturbances. Surprisingly, our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions in widely distributed smallholder agricultural systems is still limited. Knowledge of pollination dynamics in these agricultural systems is necessary to fully assess how human disturbances may affect pollination services worldwide. In this study, we describe the structure of a plant-floral visitor network in a smallholder Cucurbitaceae agricultural system. We further identify the main floral visitors of these crops and tested their importance by simulating how their extinction affected network structure and robustness. The observed network was highly connected and generalized but it was neither nested nor compartmentalized. Our results suggest that the structure of agricultural plant-pollinator networks could be inherently different from those in natural communities. These differences in network structure may reflect differences in spatial distribution of floral resources between agricultural and natural systems. We identified Augochlora nigrocyanea and Peponapis limitaris as the two most frequent floral visitors. However, removal of these species did not affect network structure or its robustness, suggesting high levels of interaction rewiring. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to describe the structure of a plant-floral visitor network in diverse agricultural systems in the tropics. We emphasize the need for more studies that evaluate network structure in agricultural systems if we want to fully elucidate the impact of human disturbances on this key ecosystem service.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity-based agriculture is the main form of agriculture practiced by smallholder farmers, who produce half the world's food, especially in the Global South. This form of agriculture relies on planned biodiversity intentionally managed by farmers and on the associated biodiversity that spontaneously colonizes the agroecosystem. In recent decades, there have been increasing calls from researchers and society to support biodiversity-based agriculture as an alternative paradigm to today's industrial agriculture. Building adapted governance and management systems for enhancing farmers' access to agrobiodiversity is a key challenge for the development of biodiversity-based agriculture. To achieve this, a better understanding of how farmer's access agrobiodiversity is needed, and in particular, how this access is affected by interactions between farmers and with institutions, i.e., social networks. In this article, we first review the literature on the role of social networks in farmers' access to agrobiodiversity, in the form of crop diversity and associated biodiversity, and the related knowledge to manage this diversity. This review points at a major knowledge gap concerning how the composition and structure of these networks affect farmers' access to agrobiodiversity. Then, we review literature on social-ecological networks to identify how this framework developed for environmental management could contribute in getting a better understanding of the role of social networks' structure and composition in farmers' access to agrobiodiversity. Based on this review, we propose a social-ecological network framework dedicated to crop diversity. Finally, we present potential applications of this framework to develop new participatory approaches for agrobiodiversity management and governance, adapted to biodiversity-based agriculture.},

The study finds that participating households had better livelihood, productivity and more diversified income portfolios during the implementation of innovative research intervention as a result of greater linkages to markets and capacity building opportunities; phasing out of the research programme reduced the diversity of income portfolios and led to the erosion of livelihoods.

One such intervention has been the AIPs that seek to bring together all stakeholders who can meaningfully contribute to the improvement of agriculture. Using largely qualitative approaches, data was collected through interviews from small scale farmers as well as different actors who were involved in the AIPs. The respondents in the study also included NGO workers, academic researchers, government workers, traditional leaders, agricultural financiers, extension workers and state-owned institutions. Using Norman Long's interface analysis as the central theoretical framework, key findings showed that communal areas were active communities that had their own socio-economic network systems which govern how smallholder farmers operate. It also emerged that IPs are a result of a combination of the social and the formal/institutionalised structures that interacted in Hwedza. The paper concludes that IPs were established in Hwedza through a series of interactive processes among actors and these were not always smooth and successful.},

A land-use system (LUS) model was formulated to represent the economic returns derived from shaded cacao production practiced by smallholders in the Toledo district of Belize. Sixty scenarios were tested to elicit response of net-present-value (NPV), returns to labor, and annual returns to land (ARTL) to individual changes in 10 system parameters. Further scenarios tested the combined interactions between hardwood shade tree type, planting density, time to harvest hardwoods, cacao cultivation practice, and expected output. As a modeling exercise, LUS analysis highlights system components that government agencies, donors, NGOs, extension agents, and smallholders should target with policies, agri-silvi- culture projects, and further research. Results identify more favorable credit, labor-saving technology, better shade-management practices, grafting, and incorporating non-hardwood shade trees and laurel (Cordia alliadora) as interventions that could improve cacao financial performance and encourage adoption.

This paper analyzes the factors influencing the probability and intensity of adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices in Ghana, and identify the possible combinations of ISFM practices used by farmers based on their perceptions of climate variability and shocks. The empirical results revealed that demographic, farm-related variables, land quality, institutional factors, relative isolation, and recent experience of climate variability and shocks influence the probability and intensity of ISFM adoption. Perceptions of climate variability and shocks have a heterogeneous effect on the adoption of multiple ISFM practices. Farmers exposed to precipitation shocks are more likely to complement mulch with residue as an adaptive response to evapotranspiration while substitute mulch with mineral fertilizer. The results highlight the risk-averse decisions and mitigation strategies employed by farmers. Providing adequate and timely climate information to farmers will mitigate the biases related to the perception of climate variability and subsequently improve soil fertility choice. Strengthening the farmer-research-extension linkages coupled with communication of “better fit” ISFM practices will increase adoption.},

However, direct sales to individual smallholders remains a challenging task without an easily scalable solution. The current research seeks to find the determinants of adoption of a stand-alone coffee index-based insurance product in Uganda marketed by a farmer cooperative, and elicited preferences for improving the design and delivery model. A stratified household survey was conducted among 614 farmers, of which 40\% adopted insurance and 62\% were member of a farmer cooperative. In odds ratio terms, adopters perceived themselves to be 3.09 times more likely to receive a pay-out than non-adopters (P{\textless}0.01), and those having better access to extension services were 2.47 times more likely to adopt a policy (P{\textless}0.01). Yet farmers perceiving the design as complex were approximately half as likely to adopt (P{\textless}0.05). Farmers preferred the option of premium payments proceeds on delivery, mobile premium payments and delivering insurance through cooperatives/associations. Deepening insurance uptake among coffee farmers will therefore require a strong focus on communication and information sharing facilitated by cooperatives/associations (e.g. farmer cooperates, village and saving associations, or women's associations).},

This paper reviews literature on trends, constraints and opportunities of smallholder irrigation in four East African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Irrigation development has been slow in these countries, and has been mainly through traditional schemes. Recently, individual irrigation technologies such as small motorized pumps, drip kits, treadle pumps, rope and washer pumps are being promoted. Adoption of these technologies and expansion of smallholder irrigation however face a number of challenges including land tenure issues; lack of access to appropriate irrigation technologies, improved agricultural inputs, reliable markets, finance and credit services, and research support; poor transport and communication infrastructures; poor irrigation water management; poor extension systems; and the over dependence on national governments, NGOs and donors for support. Despite these challenges, opportunities exist for smallholder irrigation expansion in East Africa. Such opportunities include: high untapped irrigation potential; rainwater harvesting to improve water availability; high commitment of national governments, NGOs and donors to smallholder irrigation expansion; low cost irrigation technologies adaptable to local conditions; traditional schemes rehabilitation; growing urbanization; and increased use of mobile phones that can be used to disseminate information.},

Food localization as a counter movement to globalization has been extensively studied for its debatable role in promoting the sustainability of food systems in developed economies. Previous studies failed to recognize food localization initiatives driven by the state and its significant impact on suburban farmland use. To fill this gap, this study discusses the key features of state-led food localization with the case of Nanjing, China through examining governmental policy documents, local food production plans and the remote sensing data of greenhouse expansion. Furthermore, the impacts of a state-led food localization strategy on the transition of suburban farmland use, particularly on the expansion of greenhouses, have been investigated by employing the binary logistic regression model. We argue that state-led food localization has substantially promoted the expansion of greenhouse farming for the purpose of stabilizing a sufficient local food supply, particularly vegetables. It has also provided support through means such as subsidy, agriculture extension service and technology training to smallholders, including local and migrant farmers.},

This is important because CA demands new ways of working with the farm system. Implementation will inevitably involve a reallocation of men's and women's resources as well as having an impact upon their ability to realize their gender interests. With respect to intra-household decision-making and the distribution of benefits, CA interventions have implications for labour requirements and labour allocation, investment decisions with respect to mechanization and herbicide use, crop choice, and residue management. CA practice may impact upon the ability of households to source a wide variety of crops, wild plants, and insects and small animals for household nutrition. Gender biases in extension service design can sideline women. This paper examines the limited research to date on the interactions between CA interventions and gender in East and Southern Africa, and, based on the gaps observed, sets out a research agenda. It argues that attention to gender in CA is particularly timely given the increasing interest in CA as a means of adapting to climate change.},

To improve adoption of soil productivity-enhancing technologies, two participatory methods were pursued: (i) a novel `mother-and-baby' trial design and (ii) participatory action research with Communities in a southern Malawi watershed. The central `mother trial' was managed by researchers (replicated within a site) and systematically linked to farmer-managed `baby' trials to cross-check biological performance with farmer assessment. The watershed approach involved a partnership of researchers and farmers addressing soil management. Technologies tested in both approaches integrated legumes into existing maize-based systems, sometimes in combination with inorganic fertilizers. Across methods, legume intensification increased yields by approximately 40\% (net benefit increase of approximately US\$50 ha(-1)) and fertilizer increased yields by approximately 70\% compared with continuous maize grain yields of about 1100 kg ha(-1). Farmer assessment prioritized technologies that included secondary benefits, such as weed suppression, grain legume yields, and low-labour-demanding fertilizer. A survey indicated that participating researchers and extension staff had reservations about the amount of time required to interact with farmers, and no clear consensus emerged regarding the best approach. There has been wider adoption of the mother-and-baby trial method by scientists in neighbouring countries, indicating the value of systematically incorporating farmers' input.},

Despite this, local institutional actors (LIAs)' role has not been documented as a potential entry point to address poor performance and hence increase SISs' sustainability. This study sought to assess the role of LIAs on the performance of the Tshiombo irrigation scheme (TIS). Structured questionnaires, key informant interviews (KIIs), and focus group discussions (FDGs) were used for data collection. Yield data for sweet potato, the main crop grown in the scheme, was measured as a proxy indicator for performance. Ordinary least square regression model was used to assess the relationship between LIAs and scheme performance after reducing the data using principal component analysis. The study revealed that institutional factors such as community credit support, academic extension support, academic institution market and input support, community maintenance support, and community input support positively and significantly (at 5\% level) improved the yield by a margin of 0.49, 0.12, 0.1, 0.36, and 0.10. Assessing institutional actors' interaction within each scheme will help develop linkages that will enable sustainability of irrigation schemes. Out scaling of research on LIAs on irrigation scheme performance enhances scheme performance.},

The adoption of an RRI framework is even more important for multidisciplinary and complex issues, such as the agri-food system. In this context, the SASS (Sustainable Agri-food Systems for Sustainable Development (SASS) project represents a good example for verifying the application of the RRI strategy in a varied research group committed to the development of sustainable agri-food systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. The project, which involves more than 50 researchers from different fields of knowledge and theoretical backgrounds, showed the importance of the processes of reflection, re-driving, and convergence in the definition of research objectives and strategies. This process started by experimenting with new dedicated RRI tools in order to allow interactions between the researchers, including exchanging their experience in data collection and theoretical reflection development. With respect to this analysis, it was interesting to analyze how the RRI tools and strategies have been activated between researchers and different stakeholders, generating reflections capable of re-adapting the results towards shared and accessible innovation for the extended society. Following the discussion based on the description of the SASS-RRI agenda tools and following an internal verification given from an RRI-based web survey, this contribution provides new insights, in terms of tools and strategies, to promote and refine RRI approaches. This work underlines how RRI methods have promoted internal and external interactions to connect the research objectives towards a model of open innovation.},

	abstract = {Interacting human and environmental drivers influence food and nutrition security outcomes. The way food and nutrition security problems and solutions are understood by decision makers and researchers inevitably influences interventions in food systems. One novel way of capturing different and potentially competing understandings of food and nutrition security problems and solutions is transdisciplinary research. In this paper, we examine how Southeast Asian policy and research experts working in food and nutrition security frame challenges and solutions, and the implications of this understanding for their capacity to adopt initiatives from emerging transdisciplinary research in the region. We conducted a workshop with research and policy experts from four countries in Southeast Asia and used a systems based human ecology framework to capture the common understanding participants have of the main challenges in their food systems. The systems exercises revealed similarities in the dominant framing presented by researchers and policy makers, and of the respective agencies of key stakeholders. We found that formal government policy and training was commonly perceived as major drivers of change, with smallholder farmers viewed as passive recipients of knowledge. We also found there is ongoing interest in increasing productivity of key commodities, but there is critical awareness of the environmental consequences of production-oriented agriculture. These dominant understandings have implications for current regional initiatives in transdisciplinary research that seek to build farmer capacity, reduce inequality, and include different stakeholders in research and policy activities. We conclude by arguing that research agencies aspiring to inform policy interventions based on transdisciplinary processes will face challenges given the current dominant frames of food systems in the region. We show how human ecology and systems frameworks can guide transdisciplinary food systems research that aims to improve food and nutrition security.},

Our study used a semi-qualitative approach, called Q methodology, to identify patterns of opinion on antimicrobial use, or its alternatives, among pig and poultry smallholders and drug vendors in the commune of Imerintsiatosika, in Madagascar. Twenty-nine breeders and 23 drug vendors were asked to rank, respectively, 38 and 45 statements, produced from semi-structured interviews and secondary data, through a 7 grade scale from -3 (totally disagree) to +3 (totally agree) about antimicrobial use, related risks and alternatives. The interview ended with a discussion around extreme statements. TheQ-sortingswere analyzed by factor analysis and Principal Component Analysis. Regarding antimicrobial use, antimicrobial resistance and alternatives, the breeders and drug vendors were divided according to three discourses: “A: confidence in antibiotics” (respectively, 13 and 6 individuals), “B: belief in alternatives” (7 and 7 individuals), and “C: moderate approach to antibiotic use” (6 and 6 individuals), explaining, respectively, 57 and 60\% of total variance. Group A was associated with the use of antibiotics as a preventive measure, poor knowledge of resistance and low trust in alternatives. Group B considered the preventive use of antibiotics to be a major problem for antimicrobial resistance and believed that alternatives, such as vaccines, were useful preventive methods. Group C seemed to have a hazy opinion. The presence of three main points of view offers the possibility to adapt awareness messages. Group B might also be used as a showcase to reduce the amounts of antibiotics used by the two other groups. This study revealed different practices and risk perceptions related to antimicrobial use that must be better characterized and accurately quantified.},

	abstract = {Smallholder tree plantations are seen as promising routes to alleviating poverty and increasing forest area among the countries in Southeast Asia. However, implementation has been disappointing, which led scientists at the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) to consider a scenario exercise as a way to mitigate the risk of unwanted outcomes. The study had a characteristic that it shares with many other studies: close interaction of larger-scale processes and trends (global markets, national policy) with smaller-scale systems (regional and local policy, farmer livelihoods). The authors therefore felt than an explicitly multi-scale approach was called for. To keep close to the well-known practice, we made a modest extension to a conventional scenario logic approach, and introduced a nested, and multi-scale scenario logic. While modest, we believe that the modification is useful, and the method could be used in other studies, in particular climate adaptation studies. We applied the method during two scenario workshops held to explore the use of smallholder tree plantations in efforts to improve rural livelihoods: each workshop considered two different localities. While the scenario frameworks resulting from the workshops were similar between the localities, we believe that the nested scenario framework served to structure the process and revealed meaningful contextual differences. From these experiences, we discuss and critique the method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The ineffectiveness of policy advice in most African countries could be attributed, amongst others, to the problem of scientists not being able to present or communicate a holistic solutions to policy challenges. As a result, the potential and actual consequences of policies are seldom indicated. It may be demanding to use a more comprehensive and quantitative research method in policy analysis because of limited resources to integrate technical, biophysical with the socio-economic and political variables when analysing policy effects. To exemplify this phenomenon, a forward-looking and prescriptive economic analysis that is being widely used for ex-ante policy analyses was used to make a contribution to the discussion on land redistribution, which is presently not only one of the most definitive political and development issues, but perhaps the most intractable in South Africa. The study develops and uses a mathematical model for regionalised farm-level resource use and output supply response to show that the current policy requires more economic imperatives, as it tends towards smallholder agriculture that has elements of low capital threshold trap. After 30\% of the farmland will have been transferred from the large farm type to settle more units of small farm type by 2015, the decrease in the number of large farm units from about 8531 units in the base year to about 7112 farm units will lead to a decline in crop and animal product supplies. Such declines (about 15.3\%) will overwhelm the increase of more than 1600\% in supplies as a result of increased small farm units. Given the challenges of a free market and the fact that the current farm settlement arrangement lacks appreciable efficiency, the study prescribes land redistribution strategies that consider efficiency along with equity. Taking size as an indication of efficiency, an increase in technical progress at 1, 5 and 10\% is expected to shift the supply curves to the right for less risky crop and animal enterprises meaning having more farmland, which may imply reduced lack of capital constraints would not necessarily imply a general increase in all the production activities because of relative risks in revenues. The study however, suggests that agricultural land can act as a safety net for the poor, where the efficiency argument does not hold. (C) 2008 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Wild fodder plants are valuable because they provide an important livestock feed resource globally, especially for smallholder farmers, and have important roles in natural resource management. In-depth knowledge of wild forage plants can motivate local people for feed resource and habitat conservation of threatened herbivores such as Mithun (Bos frontalis). Mithun occur in small patches in the mountains of Dulongjiang, nearby villagers domesticated this animal but left animal to freely graze in the mountains. Many fodder plants occur in these mountains, however, little is known about their nutritional value. We conducted an ethnobotanical survey to document important wild fodder plants consumed by mithun in the Dulongjiang Township. The nutritional content of 21 highly mentioned wild fodder plants in an ethnobotanical survey was examined. Laboratory analysis showed that Fagopyrum dibotrys were the fodder species with the highest crude protein (CP) content (26.89\%), followed by Polygonum molle (21.88\%) and Hydrangea longipes (21.12\%). Synthesis of relative feed value index and grey relational grade, P. molle, H. longipes and Tetrastigma obtectum were ranked the top three nutritional fodders. There was a significant difference between 21 species on their in vitro digestibility and the most highly digestible fodder species was Elatostema hookerianum. Linear model analysis on relationship between frequency of citation of 21 wild forage plants by local farmers and their nutrient composition showed that the frequency was significantly positively correlated with the nutritional value of the feed (R-2 = 0.28, P {\textless} 0.05). We concluded that these species have high nutritional values to improve mithun production in integrated crop-livestock systems. Fodder species or mixtures of species with useful nutritional characters could be cultivated to improve livestock productivity, habitat conservation including that of mithun and wild forage resource management.

	abstract = {While efforts are increasingly made to democratize research relationships, empower participants and include marginalised voices in agricultural research for development, it is acknowledged that power imbalances in knowledge creation remain integral to researcher-participant relations. Moreover, published results seldom report on the different dimensions that empowerment can encompass. This paper addresses this gap, presenting an original methodological approach for collaborating with smallholder farmers and developing an analytical framework to critically assess associated modalities of empowerment. With the intention of developing more democratic processes of knowledge production to support innovation processes, five smallholder farmer groups were invited to apply for action funds to co-develop innovations to enhance livelihoods. Employing participatory video (PV), groups applied for the grants using a `video proposal'. Group members collaboratively produced videos representing their problems, aims and innovation plans. Key findings around group empowerment are presented and reflected upon with regard to the different modalities of “power-to”, “power-with”, “power-within” and “power-over”. The PV proposal process proved to be a good tool for supporting farmer group capacity building and the development of competencies in relation to farmers' rural innovation projects. The process enhanced farmer groups' “power-to” in terms of planning capacities. This fostered motivation for action and a sense of collective ownership; thus building “power-with” at the group level. The understanding of power mobilised in this paper enabled us to highlight some context-specific limitations to democratising research relationships and creating more inclusive spaces for participatory action research and rural innovation development. These are related to entrenched socio-cultural power dynamics within the groups and to possibilities to sustain the empowerment process beyond the duration of the project. Nevertheless, funding agencies and local rural development organisations could consider the method discussed in this paper as a valuable tool for assisting marginalised groups in accessing innovation funds.},

	abstract = {Shifting agricultural land management to one that promotes the use of biological control alongside insecticide spray, requires two key elements: 1) habitat for natural enemies provided by non-crop area within the agricultural landscape, and 2) judicious use of insecticides by farmers. However, barriers to adoption may include low levels of knowledge regarding pests and natural enemies, and the difficulties associated with coordinating among community members. The acts of practicing cautious spraying and of leaving aside land as non-crop habitat (NCH) for natural enemies incur private costs for benefits shared by the community. In this study we tie together several objectives within the analysis of a framed field experiment built around pest management decisions in a smallholder agricultural context. We present results from a within-subjects design (multiple treatments per game group) that estimates a decision model which links behavior back to characteristics of the game, the players, and their group. We examine the relative role these sets of characteristics have in explaining variations in the modeled decisions, including how farmers respond to a nudge (a flat subsidy for allowing land to sit as non-crop habitat) to promote natural enemy services on the land. We observe that group-level characteristics appear to have the greatest roles in explaining how decisions by individuals are made. That is to say, the decision of whether to adopt greater use of NCH has more to do with those around the farmer than the traits of the farmer him or herself. From a policy point of view, it is a signal that (if such game outcomes have any bearing on farm level decisions) conventional data tools (such as household-level data products from household surveys or censuses) may be inadequate in evaluating appropriate incentives, and newer approaches that identify social networks and neighbor/community interactions may be important.

Policy and land use change can drastically alter fire regimes, affecting livelihoods, biodiversity, and carbon storage. In Ethiopia, burning of vegetation is banned, but the burn ban is more strongly enforced inside the Bale Mountains National Park. We investigated if and how policy and land use change have affected fire regimes inside/outside the park. The park was established in 1969, and both studied areas have been part of a new REDD+ project since 2013. Our hypothesis is that burnt heath-land stands are nonflammable and act as fuel breaks, and hence that reduced ignition rates leads to larger fires. To quantify change we analyzed remote-sensed imagery from 10 fire-seasons between 1968 and 2017, quantifying sizes of resprouting Erica stands and recording their postfire age. To elucidate underlying mechanisms of change we interviewed 41 local smallholders. There was a five order of magnitude variation in patch size ({\textless} 0.01- {\textgreater} 1000 ha). A significant interaction was found between year and site (inside/outside park) in explaining patch size, indicating that the park establishment has affected fire size. Inside the park there was a tendency of patch size increase and outside a clear decrease. Especially the largest fires ({\textgreater} 100 ha) increased in numbers inside the park but not outside. Respondents confirmed that large fires have increased in frequency and attributed this mainly to lack of fuel breaks and the fact that fires today are ignited in a more uncontrolled manner later in the dry season. Outside the park respondents explained that fires have become smaller because of increased ignition and intensified grazing. Both situations degrade pasture and threaten Erica shrub survival. For flammable ecosystems, REDD+ fire-exclusion policies need updating, and in this case complemented with a community-based fire management program making use of the vivid local traditional fire knowledge.},

	abstract = {African farming systems are highly heterogeneous: between agroecological and socioeconomic environments, in the wide variability in farmers' resource endowments and in farm management. This means that single solutions (or `silver bullets') for improving farm productivity do not exist. Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems - Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. NUANCES offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term `best-fit' technologies technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The NUANCES framework is not `just another computer model We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through `maintenance fertilization' from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies - both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next.

	abstract = {China is the world's fourth-largest country in terms of landmass. Its highly diverse biogeography presents opportunities for many invasive alien insects. However, physical and climate barriers sometimes prevent locally occurring species from spreading. China has 560 confirmed invasive alien species; 125 are insect pests, and 92 of these damage the agricultural ecosystem. The estimated annual economic loss due to alien invasive species is more than \$18.9 billion. The most harmful invasive insects exhibit some common characteristics, such as high reproduction, competitive dominance, and high tolerance, and benefit from mutualist facilitation interactions. Regional cropping system structure adjustments have resulted in mono-agricultural ecosystems in cotton and other staple crops, providing opportunities for monophagous insect pests. Furthermore, human dietary shifts to fruits and vegetables and smallholder-based farming systems result in highly diverse agricultural ecosystems, which provide resource opportunities for polyphagous insects. Multiple cropping and widespread use of greenhouses provide continuous food and winter habitats for insect pests, greatly extending their geographic range. The current management system consists of early-warning, monitoring, eradication, and spread blocking technologies. This review provides valuable new synthetic information on integrated management practices based mainly on biological control for a number of invasive species. We encourage farmers and extension workers to be more involved in training and further research for novel protection methods that takes into consideration end users' needs.},

The recurring drought is a major challenge to smallholder livestock farmers in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. This study assesses the perception of smallholder livestock farmers towards agricultural drought resilience. The study utilised a perception index score using primary data collected from 207 smallholder livestock farmers following a structured questionnaire survey and multistage sampling procedures. The study found that the average perception index of the role of social networks and government to enhance agricultural drought resilience was negative, which implied that their role in enhancing resilience towards agricultural drought was insufficient. However, the perception of smallholder livestock farmers on the role of social networks was lower than the role of government. This study recommends coordination and cooperation amongst all role players to reinforce strategies to enhance smallholder livestock farmers' resilience. This includes coordinator amongst the local, provincial government, African Farmers' Association of South Africa, extension officers, private sectors, monitoring agencies in terms of reliable early warning information and communication amongst decision-makers. Collaboration amongst government departments at the national and provincial levels should be strengthening to enhance farmer's resilience. The collaboration includes the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries at the national level, Provincial Departments of Agriculture, National and Provincial Disaster Management Centres, South African Weather Service and Department of Water Affairs. Smallholder livestock farmers' awareness of the significance of social networking and government participation should be promoted.},

In particular, small and medium agro-food business (SMABs) play a decisive and central role in the food and economies of national and underdeveloped areas. Our study aims to identify, through desk research, the level of commitment and communication to the sustainability of SMABs operating in southern Italy. In this study, we followed the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) approach to implementing such a transition, using their principles as a diagnostic tool to interpret business operations. The data were analysed using two approaches: a regime analysis to assess which FAO principles are commonly followed to make the above transition possible, and an extension of the Abraham and Pingali (2020) framework to describe the commitment of SMABs to the Agenda 2030 goals with respect to the behaviour of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We found that the SMABs' behaviours are more oriented towards some FAO principles: those that explain their commitment to improving natural resources and livelihoods, fostering inclusive economic growth, and achieving sustainable development goal 7 of Agenda 2030 than towards others. The contribution of our study lies in providing detailed insights into sustainable actions taken by SMABs while testing the FAO's principles as a new model to evaluate business operations.},

	abstract = {This study demonstrates the potential value of forecasts to smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe, the majority of whom often suffer severely from the impact of drought. Using crop simulation models to compare yield performances of farmers with and without forecasts, results indicate that, for a drought year, farmers with forecasts (WF) record higher yield gains (28\%) compared to those without forecasts (WOF): in particular, farmers located in the most arid regions (NR V) recorded the highest yield gains (42\%). A similar trend is observed during a neutral/average year, as farmers WF obtain predominantly higher yield gains (20\%) than those WOF. However, during a good year, results show a different pattern as no yield gains are observed. In fact, farmers WOF perform better, suggesting forecasts in this case may not make much difference. Using gross margin analysis, results show farmers WF obtaining higher returns during a drought (US\$ 0.14 ha(-1)) and neutral year (US\$ 0.43 ha(-1)) but again not for a good year as farmers WOF outperform those WF. To summarize, forecasts can play an important role as loss-minimization instruments especially if the underlying year is an El Nino (drought) year. In conclusion, to attain full economic value of forecasts, complementary policies (currently missing) such as effective communication, improvement in forecast extension skills and promotion of farmer participatory and outreach activities could prove vital in enhancing the value of forecasts to smallholder farmers in general.},

For most of the 10 million people who live in this region, farming is principally a way of life, not a commercial activity. A number of traditional, new and adapted intervention techniques for water harvesting and soil conservation are known in the SADC region which all aim to alleviate the most limiting crop production factors: water and soil fertility. Some of these techniques have already been researched or even implemented. This paper summarizes and highlights the major findings of such research and experiences. Socio-economic factors are considered as well as their interaction with intervention measures such as tillage methods including traditional systems, mulching and crop residue management techniques and crop selection and intercropping. The influences of termite induced micro-topography and weed competition on water harvesting and conservation are also considered. Constraints on the successful improvement or insurance of crop production in semi-arid areas of SADC are identified. Although further research will be required in certain areas, experience has shown that ensuring the large-scale practical implementation of research results via extension activities poses a greater challenge than mobilizing resources for needed research efforts. Unless this crucial step is taken, the farmers in the target areas of the SADC region will not be able to increase their yields and improve their living conditions.},

I draw from the case study of an agrarian village in Madagascar that was struck by a destructive category 3 cyclone. In the weeks following the storm, oral history knowledge occupied an increasingly visible role within the community, as younger farmers interacted with elders to hear tales of past storms. Through these shared accounts, people discussed specific techniques on how to cope with environmental uncertainty. They also created a sense of shared history, which provided individuals across generations an entry point into the local historical record. Overall, the process of sharing oral history accounts can contribute to community resilience, with resiliency encompassing not only technical or ecological factors, but also the more affective realms of shared legacies, hope and belonging.},

	abstract = {Agricultural producers grapple with low farm yields and declining ecosystem services within their landscapes. In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions (similar to 70\%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22\% to 55\%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration.},

	abstract = {Over the course of just a few years, shrimp farming has become a major aquaculture production system in coastal areas of several developing countries across the globe. However, farmers are facing a variety of risks related to disease, market, and climate, which influence risk management strategies and adoption of new technologies. This paper looks at three practices related to pond management: (1) water quality management to ensure a good environment for shrimp growth; (2) adequate feed input; and (3) disease control practices in order to mitigate the risk of disease outbreak in the pond. We investigated adoption of these three practices in smallholder shrimp farms in the Mekong Delta, by exploring how and whether membership into a producer's cluster influences access to knowledge and perception of risk in the adoption process. The results show that, after controlling for farm characteristics, farm clustering has a positive relationship with the adoption of water quality management, feed inputs, and disease control practices. Results also indicate that increasing interaction frequency with public sector and private sector's actors, as well as the perceived degree of market risk, positively influences the adoption of the three pond management practices under study. Mediation analyses show that being a member of a farmer cluster influences adoption of farming practices via two underlying processes: frequency of interaction with public and private sector's actors, and perception of market risk, both of which ultimately promote the adoption of practices. We conclude that clustering is a promising avenue for fostering interactions between farmers and key supporting actors in aquaculture, and impacts both the formation of specific aqua-related risk perceptions and subsequent practice adoption. As such, clusters - by fostering linkages and facilitating interactions between different knowledge sources - can promote adoption of practices toward sustainable intensification. However, to more effectively deploy a cluster approach a key policy and practice implication is to take into consideration local idiosyncrasies defined by their social interactions, risk perception and spatial dimensions in order to better facilitate local linkages between farms (horizontal coordination) and a better integration with the value chain (vertical coordination).},

The technologies should be developed based on actual needs, preferences, and absorptive capacity of smallholder farmers, to ensure adoption. Objective of this study was to explore needs, preferences, and absorptive capacity of smallholder farmers through direct observation on their farming practices and dialogs on constraints in intensifying food production at riparian wetlands in Indonesia.

This qualitative research was conducted in two stages: started with no-preconception Grounded Theory procedure; then, followed by questionnaire-guided survey. Results of this study indicated that intensive observation on farmer's practices and dialogs on constraints in intensifying food production could reveal needs, preferences, and absorptive capacity of smallholder farmers. Observed farmers' practices include land preparation and soil quality improvement, seedling preparation, transplanting, cropping management, and harvesting. Dialogs disclosed that unmanageable constraint but urgently needed by smallholder farmers in intensifying food production was technology solution for uncertain and uncontrollable natural flooding and drought occurrence at riparian wetlands.

	doi = {10.1186/s12917-019-2005-7},
	abstract = {Background In Africa, intensified pig production is frequently accompanied by increased occurrence of African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks, leading to high case fatality rates and socio-economic impact for the farmers. ASF control relies on prevention of disease transmission and control of outbreaks. The aim of this study was to increase the understanding on how the knowledge of ASF epidemiology and control can be transferred into successfully implemented biosecurity interventions on farm and community level. Structured interviews with 200 randomly selected, pig-keeping households in northern Uganda were undertaken three times. Perceptions related to general biosecurity and hypothetical control interventions and attitudes towards pig farming were investigated by measuring the agreement to statements using a Likert scale. Results Respondents generally conveyed positivism towards pig farming, biosecurity, and the potential of biosecurity for preventing ASF outbreaks. These positive attitudes, as well as the will to invest in biosecurity, were reduced in households that had experienced ASF outbreaks. Among the control interventions change of boots before entering the pig stable was highly accepted and seasonal adaptation of pig rearing times accepted on medium level. Statements on preventive sales of healthy pigs in connection with outbreaks and on buying pork products from slaughter operations receiving ASF-contact pigs received low acceptance, increasing, however, for households that had experienced ASF outbreaks. Consumption of pork from ASF infected pigs was generally not accepted, medium level of agreement was expressed for statements on the zoonotic potential of ASF and for neutralizing ASF by cooking. Conclusions To gain in-depth understanding of the complexity of people's behaviour, reasoning and decision-making processes, deeper involvement of the social sciences and a qualitative research approach might be used for further studies. Communicating information regarding the ASF not being zoonotic, and how the virus is neutralized will be important for increasing acceptance and enhancing implementation for the hypothetical control interventions preventive sales, safe slaughter, and consumption of processed and safe pork. Likewise, participatory development to adopt any control interventions to the local context on community level will be necessary for successful implementation.},

	abstract = {Agriculture production in Nigerien rural areas mainly depends on weather variability. Weather forecasts produced by national or international bodies have very limited dissemination in rural areas and even if broadcast by local radio, they remain generic and limited to short-term information. According to several experiences in West Africa, weather and climate services (WCSs) have great potential to support farmers' decision making. The challenge is to reach local communities with tailored information about the future weather to support strategic and tactical crop management decisions. WCSs, in West Africa, are mainly based on short-range weather forecasts and seasonal climate forecasts, while medium-range weather forecasts, even if potentially very useful for crop management, are rarely produced. This paper presents the results of a pilot initiative in Niger to reach farming communities with 10-day forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Global Forecast System (NOAA-GFS) produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). After the implementation of the download and treatment chain, the Niger National Meteorological Directorate can provide 10-day agrometeorological forecasts to the agricultural extension services in eight rural municipalities. Exploiting the users' evaluation of the forecasts, an analysis of usability and overall performance of the service is described. The results demonstrate that, even in rural and remote areas, agrometeorological forecasts are valued as powerful and useful information for decision-making processes. The service can be implemented at low cost with effective technologies making it affordable and sustainable even in developing countries. Nonetheless, the service's effectiveness depends on several aspects mainly related to the way information is communicated to the public.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of the principles (no-tillage and mulching) and components (fertilization and weeding) of conservation agriculture (CA) on crop productivity and weeds, and the interactions between principles and components, and to suggest strategies for introducing CA to smallholder farmers. The treatments consisted of tillage, fertilizer application, residues management and weed control strategies. While combined analysis showed that mulching is as effective as tillage in controlling weeds, the interaction between site and treatment revealed that in the more humid environment of Zidyana, weed dry matter obtained under no-tillage and residues plus fertilizer (NT+F+R) was 0.6 mg ha(-1) lower than under CP+F. Results suggest that about 6.0 mg ha(-1) of mulch is required to have a similar effect as tillage in controlling weeds. Fertilizer had an overriding effect on maize yield, regardless of tillage and crop residue management. Mulching was beneficial over tillage in the drier environment of Manjawira, where maize yield obtained under NT+F+R was 1.2 mg ha(-1) greater than under CP+F. Our results show that the introduction of no tillage has benefits only if it is accompanied by fertilizer application, retention of crop residues as surface mulch, and improved weed control. Increasing availability and accessibility of inputs (fertilizers and herbicides) to farmers is critical for adoption of CA at scale in Malawi.},

The intended common adaptation strategies include changes in farm management, seeking off-farm employment, emergency management planning, purchasing crop insurance, and the raising of awareness. Threat appraisal is the strongest predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted in response to slow-onset hazards (heat waves and cold spells), while coping appraisal is the major predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted to mitigate flood risk, a rapid onset hazard. Crop insurance and off-farm employment are farmers' most preferred flood adaptation strategies, while crop insurance is the most preferred adaptation strategy for heat waves and cold spells. Other variables such as the number of past implemented strategies, experience with extreme events, community organisation membership, and access to credit and extension services were also significantly associated with farmers' choices for adaptation strategies in response to the three extreme events. This information can be used to tailor community-centred communication about potential threats from different extreme weather events and government technical and financial support, which will be crucial for farmers to adapt effectively to climate change-related weather extremes.},

	abstract = {The provision of information through mobile phone-enabled agricultural information services (m-Agri services) has the potential to revolutionise agriculture and significantly improve smallholder farmers' livelihoods in Africa. Globally, the benefits of m-Agri services include facilitating farmers' access to financial services and sourcing agricultural information about input use, practices, and market prices. There are very few published literature sources that focus on the potential benefits of m-Agri services in Africa and none of which explore their sustainability. This study, therefore, explores the evolution, provision, and sustainability of these m-Agri services in Africa. An overview of the current landscape of m-Agri services in Africa is provided and this illustrates how varied these services are in design, content, and quality. Key findings from the exploratory literature review reveal that services are highly likely to fail to achieve their intended purpose or be abandoned when implementers ignore the literacy, skills, culture, and demands of the target users. This study recommends that, to enhance the sustainability of m-Agri services, the implementers need to design the services with the users involved, carefully analyse, and understand the target environment, and design for scale and a long-term purpose. While privacy and security of users need to be ensured, the reuse or improvement of existing initiatives should be explored, and projects need to be data-driven and maintained as open source. Thus, the study concludes that policymakers can support the long-term benefit of m-Agri services by ensuring favourable policies for both users and implementers.},

	abstract = {Micro-scale perspectives are seldom included in planned climate change adaptations, yet farmers' perceptions can provide useful insights into livelihood impacts from interactions between climatic and other stressors. This research aims to understand how climate variability and other stressors are impacting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Azamgarh district, eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Data from 84 smallholder farmers were collected using mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches, including interview and participatory methods, informed by multiple stressor and sustainable livelihood frameworks. Results revealed that farmers are increasingly facing problems caused by the reduced duration and number of rainy days, and erratic rainfall. Anomalies in seasonal cycles (longer summers, shorter winters) seem to have altered the local climate. Farmers reported that repeated drought impacts, even in years of moderate rainfall, are adversely affecting the rice crop, challenging the formal definition of drought. Climate variability, identified as the foremost stressor, often acts as a risk multiplier for ecological (e.g., soil sodicity), socio-economic (e.g., rising costs of cultivation) and political (e.g., mismatching policies and poor extension systems) stressors. In addition to climate stresses, resource-poor marginal groups in particular experienced higher risks resulting from changes in resource management regimes. This study provides an important cue to revisit the formal definitions of normal rainfall and drought, accommodating farmers' perceptions that evenly distributed rainfall, and not total rainfall is a key determinant of crop yields. Though India has developed adaptive measures for climate change and variability, integration of farmers' perceptions of climate and other stressors into such policies can improve the resilience of smallholder farmers, who have hitherto depended largely on autonomous adaptation strategies.},

These are capable of contributing to the realization of sustainable development goals through averting food and nutritional insecurity,increasing and sustaining yields that translate into increased incomes and later reduced poverty. This is because CSAPs enable farmers to adapt and mitigate climate change effects. However, due to inappropriate communication of CSAPs to the farmers, to date, some farmers still see no escape route from the frightening effects of climate change and they are currently adopting a rather fatalistic attitude. This study investigated the information dissemination pathways used by different categories of smallholder potato farmers for and practice of CSAPs. It found a difference between information sources and practice of CSAPs at a 5\% level of significance (chi(2) = 100.12139, df = 2, p {\textless} 0.05, Cramer's V = 1.0), and a difference in the use of the three information dissemination pathways between men and women at a 5\% level of significance (chi(2) = 6.05949, df = 2, p {\textless} 0.05, Cramer's V = 0.17406). The three information dissemination pathways included media, neighbors and friends, and extension officers. Generally, farmers were aware and practiced the CSAPs investigated in this study except for irrigation with high awareness yet with low uptake percentage and potato seedlings and minitubers both with low awareness and practice respectively. This study recommended mainstreaming of CSAPs information.},

Not all adaptation strategies are effective, due partly to differences in sensitivity to climate problems, access to livelihood assets, diversification of adaptation strategies, and flexibility and cultural relevance of institutional support. For households with lower adaptive capacity, limited adaptation choices and reliance on climate-sensitive strategies fail to unshackle them from cyclical vulnerability. Improving adaptive capacity and facilitating diversified adaptation strategies are important to address the livelihood challenges of smallholder farmers.

Understanding what mechanism behind this is critical for agricultural and environmental sustainability. By using a fixed effect panel model of over 20,000 rural households in China from 1995 to 2016, we found that the low ratio of fixed inputs such as machinery and knowledge to total inputs is the key factor leading to over-fertilization in smallholder farms. Low fixed input can result in or interact with nutrientunbalanced fertilization, low agricultural income ratio and more cash crops that further aggravate fertilizer overuse. Smallholders lack fixed inputs, then compensate by over-applying fertilizer to attempt to achieve their yield goals. Thus, improving fixed input via increasing the average farm size to 3.8 ha or advanced service rental could save not only 45\% fertilizers but also increase 16\% agricultural net profit, benefiting agricultural and environmental sustainability.},

Ethiopia has developed a legal framework on pesticide registration, distribution, and use. But regulations are not strictly implemented by the farmers, and it needs enforcement. Farmers use pesticides on crops with no or little consideration of their effect on honeybees, also the use of pesticides is harmful to pollination service, behavior, communication, forage resource, poisoning, and contaminated hive products.

This article draws on a short study conducted in the municipality of Ambatofitorahana, to the south of Ambositra in Madagascar's uplands. Acacia dealbata, a mimosa, was introduced from Australia to Madagascar, where it has become invasive but offers a renewable resource for peasant farmers. The types of uses made of this shrubby species were broadly characterised prior to the field study. The discussion of the study results, which forms the main body of this article, has led to a proposal for a multi-scale representational framework capable of producing a relevant appraisal of bioinvasion in rural environments. Investigating the full range of socio-economic and environmental impacts of a bioinvasion process means analysing multiple scales and levels of organisation, from individual plots to the country as a whole. The study clearly shows that the advantages and drawbacks of the mimosa invasion in Madagascar are specific to each level analysed. At the level of rural areas, uses of the shrub mainly revolve around bush fallows and fuel production (wood and charcoal). Our analysis shows that in rural areas, the A. dealbata invasion proceeds through successive phases of stabilisation and extension, with periods of use followed by a relative abandon of the resource closely following the same pattern. The socio-economic impacts of this bioinvasion therefore vary with the period in time being considered. At all times, use of the resource by smallholders and agricultural land use are the most effective barriers to an increase in the areas subject to mimosa invasion in Madagascar's upland regions.},

The paper starts by demonstrating that hydrology and the science of managing water resources have played key roles in human and economic development throughout history; yet these roles have often been marginalised or obscured. Knowledge of hydrology and water resources engineering and management helped to transform the landscape, and thus also the very hydrology within catchments itself. It is only fairly recent that water experts have become conscious of such mechanisms, exemplified by several concepts that try to incorporate them-integrated water resources management, eco-hydrology, socio-hydrology. We have reached a stage at which a more systemic understanding of scale interdependencies can inform the sustainable governance of water systems, using new concepts like precipitation sheds, virtual water transfers, water footprints, and water value flow.},

We consider three estimation strategies using a primary dataset of smallholder women soybean producers in the Upper West region of Ghana. We first employ probit and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to understand adoption and performance. We then employ a combined spatial-autoregressive with spatial-autoregressive disturbances (SARAR) model using generalised spatial two-stage least squares to understand cross-unit interactions in a spatial dimension. We find positive, large and significant spatial autoregressive dependence and knowledge spillover to affect the soybean yields of smallholder female farmers within spatial networks.

The rule-based dynamic simulation tool helped the researchers grasp farmers' decision-making processes but was difficult for farmers to understand due to the discrepancy between its multi-annual time step and the farmers' short-term planning horizon. The optimisation tool stimulated more strategic discussions regarding paths to improve farm income despite a design that was distant from the farmers' reality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper assesses the main policies that have been implemented in Saint Lucia's agri-food system over two time periods (pre-1950 and 1950 to 2010), and analyzes their influence on formal and informal institutions. Results suggest that rule convergence in export (formal) and domestic (informal) agricultural production systems displaced informal institutions to a lower position in the institutional hierarchy. This institutional change has reduced interactions between farming community members, with negative implications for bonding and bridging social capital in the domestic food production system. Collectively, these changes have resulted in unintended outcomes associated with the decline of many rural communities. Our findings highlight the need to better identify bridging institutions in Saint Lucia's domestic agri-food sector that could help support shared rule-making, the decentralization of power and reciprocal knowledge flows amongst policy actors.

	abstract = {Resources for crop production are often scarce in smallholder farming systems in the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Decisions on the allocation of such resources are often made at farm rather than at field plot scale. To handle the uncertainty caused by both lack of data and imperfect knowledge inherent to these agricultural systems, we developed a dynamic summary model of the soil-crop system that captures essential interactions determining the short- and long-term crop productivity, while keeping a degree of simplicity that allows its parameterisation. use and dissemination in the tropics. Generic, summary functions describing crop productivity may suffice for addressing questions concerning trade-offs on resource allocation at farm scale. Such functions can be derived from empirical (historical) data or, when they involve potential or water-limited crop yields, can be generated using process-based, detailed crop simulation models. This paper describes the approach to simulating crop productivity implemented in the model FIELD (Field-scale Interactions, use Efficiencies and Long-Term soil fertility Development), based on the availability of light, water, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and the interactions between these factors. We describe how these interactions are simulated and use examples from case studies in African farming systems to illustrate the use of detailed crop models to generate summary functions and the ability of FIELD to capture long-term trends in soil C and crop yields, crop responses to applied nutrients across heterogeneous smallholder farms and the implications of overlooking the effects of intra-seasonal rainfall variability in the model. An example is presented that evaluates the sensitivity of the model to resource allocation decisions when operating (linked to livestock and household models) at farm scale. Further, we discuss the assessment of model performance, going beyond the calculation of simple statistics to compare simulated and observed results to include broader criteria such as model applicability. In data-scarce environments such as SSA, uncertainty in parameter values constrains the performance of detailed process-based models, often forcing model users to `guess' (or set to default values) parameters that are seldom measured in practice. The choice of model depends on its suitability and appropriateness to analyse the relevant scale for the question addressed. Simpler yet dynamic models of the various subsystems (crop, soil, livestock, manure) may prove more robust than detailed, process-based models when analysing farm scale questions on system design and resource allocation in SSA.

	abstract = {While farmers sell their crops, middlemen provide a linkage between them, markets and buyers. Middlemen have good knowledge of working conditions of markets and have access to agricultural market information. Due to poor access to markets and agricultural market information by smallholders, there is a feeling that middlemen benefit more while farmers sell their crops. Good access to markets and market information may help farmers bypass middlemen while selling crops and thus benefit more. Thus, it is best to improve the informational capabilities (ICs) of farmers in agricultural marketing. Thus, this research measured ICs of farmers accessing market information, through a program NINAYO, while selling their crops. The research utilized the informational, psychological, social, and economic dimensions of the empowerment framework in identifying capability indicators to formulate survey questions. Data were collected from smallholders in six regions in Tanzania. The analysis utilized measures of life satisfaction and results showed that about half of the variation in the dependent variable, satisfaction with capabilities, was explained by the model. Backward elimination analysis confirmed that life satisfaction is multidimensional. Robustness test confirmed a positive relationship between satisfaction and capabilities. Overall, results confirmed ICs are multidimensions, their improvement empowers farmers in agricultural marketing.},

However, our understanding of the functioning of these systems is limited. Modeling offers the best approach to quantify outcomes from many interacting causal variables in these systems. The objective of this study was to develop an integrated crop-livestock model to assess biophysical and economic consequences of farming practices exhibited in sheep systems of Yucatan state, Mexico. A Vensim (TM) dynamic stock-flow feedback model was developed to integrate scientific and practical knowledge of management, flock dynamics, sheep production, partitioning of nutrients, labor, and economic components. The model accesses sheep production and manure quantity and quality data generated using the Small Ruminant Nutrition System (SRNS), and interfaces on a daily basis with an Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model that simulates weather, crop, and soil dynamics. Model evaluation indicated that the integrated model adequately represents the complex interactions that occur between farmers, crops, and livestock. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is a static positive programming model which simultaneously solves a set of microeconomic farm models reproducing the behaviour of representative individual farm households. This model is designed to capture key features of developing countries' agriculture such as the non-separability of production and consumption decisions due to market imperfections, the inter-linkage between transaction costs and market participation decisions, the interaction among farm households for factor markets and the seasonality of resource use. Model use is illustrated in this paper by simulating the impact of rice seed policy on the livelihood of representative smallholder farmers in Sierra Leone. Results show that the seed policy would improve farm productivity and boost household income but that it is not sufficient to fight poverty since 90\% of the surveyed farm households would continue to live below the extreme poverty line of 1 USD-equivalent per person per day.

	abstract = {The study explores the impacts of Nepali farmers' climate change perceptions on their farming practices over the last three decades (1980-2014). Results from a survey with 496 farmers show that nearly all farmers attributed changes in crop varieties and cropping patterns mainly to technological and market-related factors and not to climate change. A comparison between perceptions and meteorological data shows that while perceptions of changes in maximum temperatures did match observed trends, perceptions of changes in minimum temperature and rainfall did not. The results indicate that the climate change message in the past 30 years has not been definite enough to have a consistent impact on either farmers' perceptions or their farming practices. This may impede farmers' adaptive capacity in dealing with increasingly severe future climate change impacts. Because of large variations in the micro-climate of the study locations and the locations of the weather stations from which we obtained the meteorological data, the results need to be treated with caution. However, we suggest that for farmers to effectively adapt to climate change, it may be necessary for responsible state and non-state actors to improve their communication on expected climate change impacts.},

The literature was examined for the role of citizen science in supporting sustainable agriculture activities, pointing to opportunities, challenges, and recommendations. The study identified the following gaps: insufficient attention to (1) long-term capacity building and dialogue between academics and farming communities; (2) developing countries in the global South and smallholders; (3) agriculture trading and marketing; (4) the rationales of selecting target groups; (5) contributing to accelerated sustainability transitions. The main aim of the research projects reviewed in this study tended to focus on the research outcomes from an academic perspective, not sustainable solutions in practice or sustainability in general. More research is needed to address these gaps and to widen the benefits of citizen science in sustainable agricultural practices.},

This study seeks to measure the influence of palm oil innovation characteristics, the level of knowledge, social system and communication channels towards acceptance of agricultural innovation among smallholder palm oil farmers. Diffusion of Innovation Theory is adopted in formulating the theoretical framework to measure how the palm oil innovation is diffused among the smallholder farming community. This study employed a quantitative approach to obtain data from smallholder farmers in an area in Sarawak, East Malaysia. A survey using a questionnaire was used to collect data from ninety-nine (99) sampled respondents representing the smallholder palm oil farmers. From the findings, only the characteristics of innovation and communication channels significantly influenced the acceptance of oil palm innovation among the farmers on the East Coast of Malaysia. However, unlike the characteristics of innovation, which positively influenced innovation acceptance, the influence of communication channels was negative. The use of communication channels, especially radio and new media for development should be geared up as an aspect of development communication. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by IASE.},

While the CSA concept encompasses three pillars (productivity, adaptation, and mitigation), the literature has hardly addressed them in an integrated way. The development status of study sites also seems to influence which pillars are promoted. Mitigation was predominantly addressed in high-income countries, while productivity and adaptation were priorities for middle and low-income countries. Interest in institutional aspects has been gradual in the CSA literature. It has largely focused on knowledge infrastructure, market structure, and hard institutional aspects. There has been less attention to understand whether investments in physical infrastructure and actors' interaction, or how historical, political, and social context may influence the uptake of CSA options. Rethinking the approach to promoting CSA technologies by integrating technology packages and institutional enabling factors can provide potential opportunities for effective scaling of CSA options.},

	abstract = {Concentrates are the main cash expenditure in smallholder campesino dairying in the highlands of Central Mexico. Improved, low-cost, appropriate feeding strategies have been therefore identified by campesinos as a priority. An on-farm trial was undertaken in 1998 to evaluate the response to supplementation with concentrates by dairy cows in early lactation during the rainy season with restricted access to grazing of ryegrass/white clover pastures. A base of 3.0 kg commercial concentrate/cow/day (S3) was compared against the higher rate used by farmers of 5.0 kg/cow/day (S5). Three farmers with one, and one farmer with two pairs of freshly calved upgraded Holstein cows participated in the trial (24 +/- 10.7 days into lactation). Data were analysed by a random block split-plot design where supplementation treatments were main plots and measurement periods were split-plots. Milk yield was recorded once per week for 9 weeks, and live weight and condition score for four 28 day periods. Milk yields were 21.8 for S3 and 21.9 for S5 (+/-0.714) kg milk/day/cow (P {\textgreater} 0-05); live weight S3 = 444.0 and S5 = 496.0 (+/- 12.663) kg/cow (P {\textgreater} 0.05), and condition score S3 = 1.9, and S5 = 1.8 (+/-1.127) (P {\textgreater} 0.05). There were no significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) effects of measurement periods, and there was no significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) interaction. The lack of response in milk yield, live weight or condition score to increased concentrate supplementation demonstrates that at these levels of production and management, the access to grazing of improved pastures, plus limited concentrate, enables cows in campesino systems to meet their nutrient requirements, and the feasibility of efficient milk production from grazed pastures as an appropriate technology. It is also concluded that it is an appropriate technology and that the results have implications for research and extension workers in rural development who have promoted large amounts of concentrate to dairy cows as the only way towards high yields and efficient milk production.},

The strata were upper-midlands (UM) I zero-grazing, UM 1 open-grazing, UM 2 zero-grazing, UM 4 zero-grazing and UM 4 open-grazing. In total, 225 calves on 188 smallholder dairy farms were visited within the first 2 weeks of life and thereafter at biweekly intervals up to the age of 6 months between March 1995 and August 1996. During each visit, the calves were weighed and other calf-management practices in the farm during the visit such as housing, feeding and tick control also were recorded. Other events such as morbidity and mortality between or during the visits were also recorded. The overall mean daily weight gains were 0.24-0.29 kg (S.D. = 0.17-0.22 kg) and were lower than the recommended targets for smallholder farms of 0.40-0.50 kg. The major tendency in variability of daily weight gains was due to visit-to-visit variation (especially in calves {\textgreater}3 months old). Differences in mean daily gains were associated with AEZ-grazing strata and calf-level factors that included breed of calf, calf sickness, incidence of ECF, feeding of milk, concentrate feeds and minerals and interaction between calf age and AEZ-grazing strata (P {\textless} 0.05). ECF and other calf sicknesses exerted a temporal effect on calf-growth at the height of illness and immediately after; calves later recovered the lost growth except where other factors such as poor calf nutrition prevailed. Improvement in calf-growth in Murang'a District is achievable and extension services should continue to target individual-calf-level management practices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In many places in the tropics and subtropics, livestock systems are changing rapidly, and the spatial heterogeneity of household response to change may be very large. While opportunities may exist for some households to take advantage of more conducive rangeland and cropping conditions, for example, the changes projected will pose serious problems for many other households. We briefly review the literature on climate change impacts on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries, and identify some key knowledge and data gaps. We also list some of the broad researchable issues associated with how smallholders and pastoralists might respond to climate change.

	abstract = {A long history of household-level research has provided important local-level insights into climate adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector. It remains unclear to what extent these strategies are generalizable or vary across regions. In this study we ask about three potential key factors influencing farming households' ability to adapt: access to weather information, household and agricultural production-related assets, and participation in local social institutions. We use a 12-country data set from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to explore the links between these three potential drivers of agricultural change and the likelihood that farmers made farm-associated changes, such as adopting improved crop varieties, increasing fertilizer use, investing in improved land management practices, and changing the timing of agricultural activities. We find evidence that access to weather information, assets, and participation in social institutions are associated with households that have reported making farming changes in recent years, although these results vary across countries and types of practices. Understanding these drivers and outcomes of farm-associated changes across different socio-economic and environmental conditions is critical for ongoing dialogues for climate-resilient strategies and policies for increasing the adaptive capacity of smallholders under climate change.

	abstract = {The low productivity of smallholder farming systems and enterprises is attributed mainly to the limited resources of farming households and to the application of inappropriate skills and practices that can lead to land degradation. Land productivity may be raised by improved soil and water management and by mechanization (considering the whole spectrum of power sources) that makes better use of human labour and other resources. However, mechanization programmes, which facilitate soil and water management, have to consider cultural and social factors as well as the immediate technical and economic issues. The livelihoods approach provides a framework for dealing with such considerations, which can be elicited through the participation of farmers in the research and development activities. Examples are given of participatory research (i.e. research in which scientists and farmers participate as partners) to raise smallholder productivity sustainably in India, Zimbabwe and Latin America. Sustainability is a key issue for economic security in the longer term, and depends on many interacting factors both within and outside the tasks of crop production. The most significant of these factors are discussed and it is emphasized that involving farmers provides a reliable means of accounting for them and enabling the farmers to apply new knowledge to raise productivity, but within the contexts of their own livelihood strategies.

In contrast most previous theoretical literature on household agricultural decision making and land-use change in rural areas considers conditions of high population density and land scarcity and is not, therefore, adequate for understanding critical land-use changes which may be occurring in frontier regions. This article first discusses the appropriateness and inadequacies of the analytical frameworks commonly used to explain the expansion of settler agriculture into remote forest regions and the unsustainable land-use practices observed in these areas. This review serves as the basis for characterizing resource allocation under the particular conditions of frontier environments. A conceptual advance in the analysis is its consideration of the way institutional/policy factors and farm-level characteristics can interact to produce land-use outcomes. This knowledge is essential to understand not only the social and economic factors affecting present land use and choice of technology, but also those factors influencing farmers' demand for more optimal systems of land use which are consistent with varying agro-ecological potentials demographic situations, and their own management capacity.},

Benefits in reduced erosion and stabilized crop production may be obtained, but technical performance at field level is but one of the determinants of adoption. For various reasons, all of the CA principles are not always fully implemented by farmers and results not as favourable as expected. As with other approaches to increasing agricultural productivity, the production constraints, farmers' objectives, and the expected benefits and costs of implementing CA are important aspects that influence adoption. At farm and village levels, trade-offs in the allocation of resources become important in determining how CA may fit into a given farming system. At a regional level, factors such as the market conditions, interactions among stakeholders and other institutional and political dimensions become important. At each level, opportunities or difficulties emerge that enhance or impede development, adaptation and adoption of CA. The ex-ante identification of situations for where CA (and which form of CA) is appropriate demands research from a multi-stakeholder, multi-level, and interdisciplinary perspective.

We developed new knowledge of agriculture clearing sizes, spatial patterns, and relationships with roads in seven case study sites comprising 7,529 km(2). Using very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, we mapped roads and rivers, plus clearings for agriculture, settlements, and logging. Mapped clearings (N = 1,781) ranged in size from 0.008 ha to more than 300 ha; most were smallholder agriculture, with 64 percent {\textless}= 1 ha. Statistical tests of spatial pattern confirmed that agriculture occurred in an inhomogeneous-aggregated pattern, suggesting interactions with other landscape elements. Proximity analyses showed that 76 percent of clearings were within 1 km of a road or river. Thirty-five percent of agriculture clearings were within 1 km of main public roads built before 1990, compared to 17 percent for logging roads built after 2000. Less than 6 percent of agriculture clearings were within 1 km of logging roads with overgrown canopies, suggesting transient relationships. Results based on fine-scale data provide new empirical support for understanding the interactions between agriculture and roads in one of the remaining relatively intact forest areas of the Congo Basin.},

	abstract = {The transportation load of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) seedlings from the nursery to planting sites is a crucial problem facing the extension of smallholder plantations in Cameroon. This load can be considerably reduced by removing soil from the roots, which in turn exposes the plants to water and nutrients stresses. A greenhouse pot experiment was carried out to evaluate the recovery performance of such soil-stripped seedlings as a function of watering frequency and soil texture. Plant recovery potential was monitored on 360 nursery seedlings aged 4 months, under two soil types (sandy clay soil with 46\% fine particles and sandy loam soil with 19\% fine particles) and two watering frequencies (daily and two-days). Three monthly measurements were taken on morphological plant growth parameters including Plant height, Foliar surface, Collar diameter, Root length and Plant weight. Within and between groups analyses of variance and means separation showed the greatest variability for collar diameter, foliar surface and plant weight. All the parameters showed a greater variability and an almost-constant growth from one month to another, except for plant weight that did show a highly significant (p = 0.000) increase between the first measurement and the second. Soil type, watering and their interaction explained 97-99.5\% of the variations of all parameters. Except for root length, all other parameters were more sensitive to the effect of soil texture, explaining 83-95\% of the total variation. Only plant weight and root length showed slightly greater values under daily watering, other parameters did not show any sensibility to the two watering frequencies proposed in this experiment. Our results showed a low response of plant growth recovery on the low clay sandy loam soil, revealing that a careful selection of a soil texture is crucial for the survival of seedlings and further establishment of the plants following drought stress. It is therefore strongly recommended to many tropical countries where oil palm is an economically important crop, to take this into account during the selection of soil type for oil palm seedlings nursery.},

	abstract = {The farm-level economics of conservation agriculture (zero tillage, mulching and crop rotation) are described, reviewed and modelled. The economics are defined broadly to include not just short-term financial benefits and costs, but also the whole-farm management context, constraints on key resources such as labour and capital, risk and uncertainty, interactions between enterprises, and time-related factors, such as interest rates and the urgency of providing for the farm family. A wealth of evidence shows that these economic factors and variables related to them have significant influences on farmers' decisions about adoption of conservation agriculture. Literature on the farm-level economics of conservation agriculture for resource-poor farmers is reviewed. There is not a large body of high-quality relevant studies. Those that have been published highlight that the economics are highly heterogeneous and need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Their results tend to indicate that it would be profitable to adopt conservation agriculture or components of it (although not in all cases). This contrasts with disappointing adoption in many of the regions of interest. Potential reasons for this disparity are discussed. A general model of the farm-level economics of conservation agriculture and its components is presented, and used to illustrate influences on the overall economic attractiveness of conservation agriculture. Key factors that would tend to discourage adoption in situations that otherwise look favourable include: the opportunity cost of crop residues for feed rather than mulch, the short-term reduction in yields under zero tillage plus mulching in some cases, combined with short planning horizons and/or high discount rates of farmers, farmer aversion to uncertainty, and constraints on the availability of land, labour and capital at key times of year. Good quality economic analysis should be used more extensively to guide research and extension in this area, particularly in relation to the targeting of effort, and adaptation of the system to suit local conditions.

	abstract = {Cocoa agroecosystems are a major land-use type in the tropical rainforest belt of West Africa, reportedly associated with several ecological changes, including soil degradation. This study aims to develop a composite soil degradation assessment index (CSDI) for determining the degradation level of cocoa soils under smallholder agroecosystems of southwestern Nigeria. Plots where natural forests have been converted to cocoa agroecosystems of ages 1-10, 11-40, and 41-80 years, respectively representing young cocoa plantations (YCPs), mature cocoa plantations (MCPs), and senescent cocoa plantations (SCPs), were identified to represent the biological cycle of the cocoa tree. Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 to 20 cm in each plot and analysed in terms of their physical, chemical, and biological properties. Factor analysis of soil data revealed four major interacting soil degradation processes: decline in soil nutrients, loss of soil organic matter, increase in soil acidity, and the breakdown of soil textural characteristics over time. These processes were represented by eight soil properties (extractable zinc, silt, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), available phosphorus, total porosity, pH, and clay content). These soil properties were subjected to forward stepwise discriminant analysis (STEPDA), and the result showed that four soil properties (extractable zinc, cation exchange capacity, SOM, and clay content) are the most useful in separating the studied soils into YCP, MCP, and SCP. In this way, we have sufficiently eliminated redundancy in the final selection of soil degradation indicators. Based on these four soil parameters, a CSDI was developed and used to classify selected cocoa soils into three different classes of degradation. The results revealed that 65\% of the selected cocoa farms are moderately degraded, while 18\% have a high degradation status. The numerical value of the CSDI as an objective index of soil degradation under cocoa agroecosystems was statistically validated. The results of this study reveal that soil management should promote activities that help to increase organic matter and reduce Zn deficiency over the cocoa growth cycle. Finally, the newly developed CSDI can provide an early warning of soil degradation processes and help farmers and extension officers to implement rehabilitation practices on degraded cocoa soils.},

	abstract = {Intercropping is a common practice in low productivity (low input low output) small-scale farming systems. However, as the level of productivity increases due to technological improvements whether intercropping compared to sole cropping remains the most productive and resource efficient cropping system is not well understood. Here we hypothesize that inter-crops outperform sole crops at low levels of resource availability because of improved resource capture and resource use efficiency; and answered whether this advantage decreases with increasing levels of resource availability. The performance of three cropping systems i.e. maize intercropped with navy bean, sole maize and sole navy bean were evaluated at three levels of resource input i.e. a low water/nitrogen (low W/N), a medium water/nitrogen (medium WIN), and a high water/nitrogen (high W/N), in three independent experiments, conducted over two consecutive years. The performance of the cropping systems was evaluated in terms of land equivalent ratios (LER), total grain yield, protein and energy productions as well as resource (water, nitrogen, and solar radiation) capture and use efficiency. Our results indicate that maize productivity (grain yield, protein and energy productions) was not significantly affected by the intercrop at any level of resource availability. However, irrespective of the level of resource input, intercropping significantly reduced the productivity of navy bean. The advantage of the intercropping, in terms of LER, tended to decrease with increasing the level of water and nitrogen supply i.e. decreased from 28\% to 6\% for above ground biomass, from 40\% to 7\% for grain yield, from 41\% to 0.3\% for protein production and from 40\% to 9.2\% for energy production. Intercropping was therefore more efficient in terms of LER under low W/N than under high W/N conditions. The LER was directly related to improved capture of nitrogen and to higher water use efficiency. Here we conclude that in terms of LER, intercropping systems are more resource efficient and suitable for lower productivity environments. As more productive technologies are adopted by smallholder farmers, agricultural development projects and extension services need to consider under what conditions sole cropping become a more productive system.

This situation limits farmers' ability to make optimal decisions for food and income security. Developing more useful and accessible weather and climate information services (WCIS) can help small-scale farmers improve their adaptive capacity. The literature suggests that such WCIS can be achieved if forecast information is produced jointly by farmers and scientists. To test this hypothesis and derive design requirements for effective WCIS, we evaluated the outcomes of an experimental coproduction of weather forecasts in Ada, Ghana. The experiment involved a user-driven design and testing of information and communications technology (ICT)-based digital (smartphones and apps) and rainfall monitoring tools by 22 farmers. They collected data and received weather forecasts during the 2018/2019 study period. The results showed a positive evaluation of the intervention, expressed by the level of engagement, the increase in usability of the tools and understanding of forecast uncertainty, outreach capacity with other farmers, and improved daily farming decisions. The success of the intervention was attributed to the iterative design process, as well as the training, monitoring, and technical support provided. We conclude that the application of modern technology in a coproduction process with targeted training and monitoring can improve smallholder farmers' access to and use of weather and climate forecast information.},

An international research project investigated the smallholder agrobiodiversity of maize (corn) in a global hotspot (Bolivia) undergoing significant intensification. Peach-based intensification was pronounced (300-400\%) and prolonged (2000-2010) in study areas. Intensification and maize agrobiodiversity were found to co-occur within smallholder landscapes. Interactions of these field systems did not trigger land-change tipping points leading to landrace extirpation. By 2010 maize landraces in the study areas still demonstrated high levels of taxonomic and ecological biodiversity and contributed significantly to this crop's agrobiodiversity at national (31\%) and hemispheric (3\%) scales. Social and ecological resilience and in situ conservation of the maize agrobiodiversity by Bolivian smallholders was enabled through robust linkages to off-farm migration; resource access and asset capabilities-among both traditional and nontraditional growers; landrace agroecology and food uses; and innovative knowledge and skills. The smallholders' resilience resulting from these linkages was integral to the conditional success of the in situ conservation of maize agrobiodiversity. Environment-development interactions both enabled smallholders' agrobiodiversity resilience and influenced the limits and vulnerability of agrobiodiversity. Scientific policy recommendations regarding land-use planning and sustainability analysis are targeted to specific Rio+20 priorities for agrobiodiversity.},

Rice is one such important food and cash crop experiencing high PHLs. Given the limited mechanization of smallholder farms, PHLs result from practices influenced by knowledge, decision-making power in the household and cultural norms. Gender is an important consideration in the interaction of these factors especially for a duo purpose crop like rice serving both food and income security interests of households. A descriptive cross-sectional survey informed by qualitative focus group discussions was conducted in two major rice producing districts in Eastern Uganda to establish how gender division of labour and decision-making influence PHLs at the household level. The intra-household gender structure, division of labour and decision-making determine the postharvest loses of rice at the household level. Men and boys perform the labour intensive postharvest activities where postharvest losses are high. They also dominate decisions on the practices and technologies used. Due to labour intensity and cultural norms, households without men rely on hired labour, which increases their PHLs resulting from late access to and inadequate supervision of the hired labour. Interventions for reduction of PHLs at the household level must target men with better practices and simple cost-effective technologies.},

It was carried out in the Udayapur district of Nepal, where the application of CRA practices into vegetable farming has introduced jholmol (a bio-pesticide and nutrient supplement); water conservation technologies; support for formation of farmers' groups; regular technical follow-up; and flow of regular market information through short message services (SMS: that is, text messaging). This study is based on the discussions of five focus groups held with local farmers, and on 300 interviews with participating households in the study area. The results indicate that CRA generates multiple benefits compared to conventional agricultural practices. For instance, the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of CRA practice is 1.81 as compared to 1.02 for conventional farming. In addition, practicing CRA has changed the food habits of farmers, since the proportion of vegetables consumed in their regular meals has increased substantially. Farmers are also engaging in vegetable farming in their leisure time, instead of drifting around their villages. However, CRA practice demands capital NPR. 537,695/ha/year (USD 5220/ha/year) as compared to conventional agricultural practice NPR. 140,171/ha/year (USD 1361/ha/year). Formation of the farmers' group probably promoted dissemination of knowledge on CRA practices, as it facilitated interaction and the exchange of ideas. CRA is, therefore, an integrated approach rather than the simple provision of technology.},

Specifically, the study sought to tap into the expertise and perspectives of locally important stakeholders in the potentially sensitive Wami/Ruvu River catchment of Tanzania. Participatory scenario planning was used to explore sectors sensitive to climate variability and change. This included 84 selected smallholder farmers and their leaders spread across six villages within the catchment. Quantitative household surveys were conducted across 199 households and Supplementary information sourced from regional statistics. The survey indicates that farmers project that land and agricultural productivity and water resources will be affected by climate change. From the participatory approach adopted for the study, thematic scenario categories featuring land and water resource-use and management and farm productivity were developed. The research found scenario analysis as a useful tool in development planning, as it incorporates interacting risks and uncertainties. If adopted by local farmers, leaders, regional institutional frameworks and policy makers, the tool has the potential to improve responsiveness to changes and risks through its collaborative management approach. This study demonstrates the need for sustainable water use and management systems and land use and farming practices that will increase crop productivity and resilience to climate variability and change.

Seasonal climate outlooks provide information on expected annual rainfall and thus can be used to adjust seasonal agricultural strategies to respond to expected climate conditions. A case study of smallholder farmers in a village in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province, South Africa has been used to examine how such climate outlooks might influence agricultural strategies and how this climate information can be improved to be more useful to farmers. Empirical field data has been collected using surveys, participatory approaches and computer-based knowledge elicitation tools to investigate the drivers of decision-making with a focus on the role of climate, market and livelihood needs. This data is used in an agent-based social simulation which incorporates household agents with varying adaptation options which result in differing impacts on crop yields and thus food security, as a result of using or ignoring the seasonal outlook. Key variables are the skill of the forecast, the social communication of the forecast and the range of available household and community-based risk coping strategies.

The results show that the perception levels of land degradation and eco-friendly soil-management practices are very high, and more than 70\% of the respondents indicated that they wanted to adopt the practices; however, only a small portion of the interviewed farmers made the final decision to apply these practices. Of all the factors, perception of practices and adoption attitude were the most important ones influencing farmers' adoption decision positively. Knowledge of environmental regulations, risk type, degree of farmland fertility, agro-technical training, participation in agricultural insurance, interaction with other farmers and membership in farmers' organizations had positive relationships with adoption decisions, whereas availability of farming funding influenced adoption decisions negatively. According to these findings, ensuring agricultural profit is the primary basis for farmers' adoption decisions; however, agricultural informationespecially information about eco-friendly soil-management technologiesshould also be widely dispersed, and environmental regulations should be strictly enforced.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how double exposure to economic and environmental stressors - and the interaction between the two - affect smallholder farmers in Mozambique's Limpopo River Basin. Studying two case study villages we find that people, in general, are resilient to environmental stressors. However, most households show less resilience to the socioeconomic stressors and shocks that have been introduced or intensified by economic globalisation. Our findings indicate that economic change brought about by structural adjustment policies pressures rural people to alter their approach to farming, which makes it more difficult for them to respond to environmental change. For example, smallholder farmers find it difficult to make a transition to commercial farming within the Limpopo Basin, in part because farming techniques that are well adapted to managing environmental variability in the region - such as seeding many small plots - are not well suited to the economies of scale needed for profitable commercial agriculture. People use a variety of strategies to cope with interactive environmental and economic stressors and shocks, but many face considerable constraints to profitably exploiting market-based opportunities. We conclude that economic stressors and shocks may now be causing small-scale agriculture to be less well adapted to ecological and climate variability, making smallholders more vulnerable to future climate change. Some local level policy interventions, including those that support and build on local environmental knowledge, could assist rural agricultural societies in adapting to future environmental change in the context of economic globalisation.},

	doi = {10.1080/13549839.2016.1272560},
	abstract = {In El Salvador a growing permaculture movement attunes small-scale farming activities to principles of ecological observation. The premise is twofold: close-grained appreciation of already-interacting biophysical processes allows for the design of complementary social and agricultural systems requiring minimum energy inputs. Secondly, the insistence on campesino smallholders as actors in the design of sustainable food systems directly addresses decades of “top-down” developmental interventions, from Green Revolution experiments in the 1960s and 1970s to international food security programmes in the 1990s. Permaculture connects food insecurity to the delegitimisation of smallholder innovation and insists that, through sharing simple techniques, campesino farmers can contribute towards future-oriented questions of environmental sustainability. This repositioning is brought about through the mobilisation of pedagogical techniques that legitimise the experiences and expertise of small-scale farmers, while standardising experimental methods for testing, evaluating and sharing agroecological practices. Like food sovereignty and food justice movements, Salvadoran permaculture links hunger with longer histories of (uneven) capital accumulation and dispossession and renders campesino farmers its protagonists. By modelling a form of expertise premised in intimate involvement with specific environments, permaculture goes still further, seeking to dislodge a pervasive knowledge politics that situates some as knowers and innovators, and others as passive recipients. This grounds human rights in an ethos of caring for the “more-than-human” world and places emphasis on a corollary right as part of food justice, increasingly being demanded “from below”: the right to know.},

	abstract = {We investigate the influence of an agricultural TV edutainment programme on farmers' decisions to implement changes of agricultural practices. We use data obtained from a survey conducted with 1572 households in Kenya across the target areas of a TV edutainment programme, Shamba-Shape-Up (SSU). A conceptual framework is developed to account for the interaction between farmers watching SSU and internal factors including farmer's and households characteristics, farmer's views on farming, their trust of sources of influence and their decisions to change their agricultural practices. Structural equations and probit models are used to understand how watching the edutainment TV programme Shamba Shape-Up (SSU) along with farmers and households characteristics affect maize and dairy farmer's probability to make changes to agricultural practices shown in SSU. We find that SSU has an influence on maize and dairy farmers' decisions to implement changes of agricultural practices. Farmers who watch SSU have a higher probability to implement a greater number of agricultural practices. However, SSU influence varies depending on the agricultural practice recommended as well as on the reasons that farmers have for watching the programme. The probability of implementing agricultural practices shown on SSU was not dependent on the associated difficulty of making such changes. Edutainment TV can be a viable approach to nudge farmers to implement practices that contribute to addressing local and global challenges including adapting to and mitigating against climate change, reducing poverty, and increasing productivity and income of smallholders in developing countries.},

Crop losses caused by BCMV and BCMNV impact severely not only on commercial scale cultivation of this high-value crop but also on production by smallholder farmers in the developing world, where bean serves as a key source of dietary protein and mineral nutrition. In many parts of the world, progress has been made in combating BCMV through breeding bean varieties possessing the I gene, a dominant gene conferring resistance to most BCMV strains. However, in Africa, and in particular in Central and East Africa, BCMNV is endemic and this presents a serious problem for deployment of the I gene because this virus triggers systemic necrosis (black root disease) in plants possessing this resistance gene. Information on these two important viruses is scattered throughout the literature from 1917 onward, and although reviews on resistance to BCMV and BCMNV exist, there is currently no comprehensive review on the biology and taxonomy of BCMV and BCMNV. In this chapter, we discuss the current state of our knowledge of these two potyviruses including fundamental aspects of classification and phylogeny, molecular biology, host interactions, transmission through seed and by aphid vectors, geographic distribution, as well as current and future prospects for the control of these important viruses.},

	abstract = {Policy measures regarding adaptation to climate change include efforts to adjust socio-economic and ecologic systems. Colombia has undertaken various measures in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation since becoming a party of the Kyoto protocol in 2001 and a party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. The first national communication to the UNFCCC stated how Colombian agriculture will be severely impacted under different emission scenarios and time frames. The analyses in this document further support that climate change will severely threaten the socioeconomics of Colombian agriculture. We first query national data sources to characterize the agricultural sector. We then use 17 Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural production may be affected by climate change, and show the expected changes to years 2040-2069 (”2050”) under the A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A2) and the overall trends in both precipitation and temperature to 2100. We then evaluate expected changes within different regions and measure the proportion of area affected within each crop's distributional range. By 2050, climatic change in Colombia will likely impact 3.5 million people, 14 \% of national GDP corresponding to agriculture, employment of 21 \% of the population, agro-industries, supply chains, and food and nutritional security. If no adaptation measures are taken, 80 \% of crops would be impacted in more than 60 \% of their current areas of cultivation, with particularly severe impacts in high value perennial and exportable crops. Impacts also include soil degradation and organic matter losses in the Andes hillsides; likely flooding in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts; niche losses for coffee, fruit, cocoa, and bananas; changes in prevalence of pests and diseases; and increases in the vulnerabilities of non-technically developed smallholders. There is, however, still time to change the current levels of vulnerability if a multidisciplinary focus (i.e., agronomic, economic, and social) in vulnerable sectors is undertaken. Each sub-sector and the Government need to invest in: (1) data collection, (2) detailed, regionally-based impact assessments, (3) research and development, and (4) extension and technology transfer. Support to vulnerable smallholders should be given by the state in the form of agricultural insurance systems contextualized under the phenomenon of climate change. A national coordination scheme led by (but not restricted to) the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) with the contributions of national and international institutions is needed to address agricultural adaptation.},

	abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa problems associated with water scarcity are aggravated by increasing demands for food and water, climate changeand environmental degradation. Livestock keeping,an important livelihood strategy for smallholder farmers in Africa, is a major consumer of water, and its water consumption is increasing with increasing demands for livestock products. At the same time, current low returns from livestock keeping limit its contribution to livelihoods, threaten environmental health and aggravate local conflicts. The objectives of this review are to: (1) synthesize available knowledge in the various components of the livestock and water sectors in sub-Saharan Africa, (2) analyze livestock-water interactions and (3) identify promising strategies and technological interventions for improved livestock water productivity (LWP) using a framework for mixed crop-livestock systems. The interventions are grouped in three categories related to feed, water, and animal management. Feed related strategies for improving LWP include choosing feed types carefully, improving feed quality, increasing feed water productivity, and implementing grazing management practices. Water management for higher LWP comprises water conservation, watering point management, and integration of livestock production in irrigation schemes. Animal management strategies include improving animal health and careful animal husbandry. Evidence indicates that successful uptake of interventions can be achieved if institutions, policies, and gender are considered. Critical research and development gaps are identified in terms of methodologies for quantifying water productivity at different scales and improving integration between agricultural Sectors.

	abstract = {Rodents present a major problem for food security in Asia where smallholder farming families are particularly vulnerable. We review here recent developments in the biology and management of rodent pests in cereal cropping systems in Asia. The past decade has seen a strong focus on ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM), its adoption in field studies significantly increased rice yields (6-15\%) and income ({\textgreater}15\%) in seven Asian countries. EBRM principles have also been successfully applied to maize in China. We provide case studies on EBRM in Cambodia, on interactions between rodent pests and weeds, and on the importance of modified wetlands for biodiversity and rodent pest management. Knowledge on post-harvest impacts of rodents is increasing. One research gap is the assessment of human health impacts from a reduction of rodent densities in and around houses. We identify 10 challenges for the next decade. For example, the need for population modelling, a valuable tool missing from our toolbox to manage rodent pests in cereal systems. We also need to understand better the interactive effects of cropping intensification, conservation agriculture and climate change. Finally, new management approaches such as fertility control are on the horizon and need to be considered in the context of smallholder cereal farming systems and mitigating health risks from zoonotic diseases associated with rodents.

	abstract = {Large-scale land exploitation to jumpstart backward economies is often accompanied by massive environmental impacts. The broad concepts of productivity-oriented `bio-economy' and conservation-oriented `eco-economy' were proposed to transform exploitative land-based economies. Taking cases in Borneo as core examples, this paper explores 10 transformative strategies for sustainability: boosting upstream productivity of cash crops, activating under-utilised low carbon (ULC) land for production, upgrading and diversifying downstream activities, branding for more values (industrial), establishing new domestic demand for bio-resources, creating values for carbon and ecosystem services, enhancing agro-ecological resilience, establishing eco-based tertiary sectors, branding for more values (smallholders), and encouraging self-sufficient farming. Generally, utility-based development strategies with wealth creation as the centre of policy-making are inadequate to repair the previous environmental damage. Likewise, strategies that prioritise restoration have shown a limited contribution to economic growth as observed in the case of Borneo. The interconnected nature of economic productivity and conservation means that no single strategy is a perfect solution but a combination of them may produce a better outcome. While integrated landscape analysis that combines land-use models and economic analyses can facilitate understanding of the systems, in-depth area studies are necessary to capture the more subtle `human factors' like socio-political dynamics. The existence of multiple stakeholders with different interests and values means that an `optimal' combination would be a result of political negotiations rather than scientific investigations. To design and also effectively execute the strategies, communication, collaboration and co-production of knowledge between scientific communities and various stakeholders is imperative.},

Four hundred and seventy one pig farms slaughtering finisher pigs at government operated abattoirs participated in this study. The objectives of this study were to group: (a) smallholder (S) and commercial (C) production systems into patterns according to their herd health providers (HHPs), and obtain descriptive information about the grouped Sand C production systems; and (b) identify key HHPs within each production system using social network analysis. On-farm veterinarians, private consultants, pharmaceutical company representatives, government veterinarians, livestock and agricultural technicians, and agricultural supply stores were found to be actively interacting with pig farmers. Four clusters were identified based on production system and their choice of HHPs. Differences in management and biosecurity practices were found between Sand C clusters. Private HHPs provided a service to larger C and some larger S farms, and have little or no interaction with the other HHPs. Government HHPs provided herd health service mainly to S farms and small C farms. Agricultural supply stores were identified as a dominant solitary HHP and provided herd health services to the majority of farmers. Increased knowledge of the routine management and biosecurity practices of S and C farmers and the key HHPs that are likely to be associated with those practices would be of value as this information could be used to inform a risk-based approach to disease surveillance and control.

	abstract = {Orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) can contribute to combating vitamin A deficiency and establishing more resilient cropping systems in sub-Saharan Africa. There is limited understanding of the factors that affect yield and quality of OFSP on smallholder farmers' fields. This study aimed to assess the performance of six OFSP varieties, identify factors limiting productivity and explore options to close the gap between actual and attainable OFSP yields on fields of smallholder farmers. Data were collected in the 2015/16 growing season from 221 on-farm variety demonstrations in seven districts in Central and Southern Malawi. Dependent variables of interest included crop establishment, vine yields, storage root formation, root yields, percentage of marketable root yield, and weevil infestation. Using linear mixed models, a range of biophysical, climatic, management and socio-economic factors and variables was used to identify associations with these dependent variables. The root yield gap was explored using a multivariate boundary line model to identify the most yield limiting factors. Results show a large variability across farmers' fields and a wide range of interacting factors affecting the variables of interest. Varieties Chipika and Kadyaubwerere attained good yields and were preferred by farmers in terms of taste. Varieties Zondeni and Anaalcwanlre gave a poor root yield, but a good vine yield. Timely planting is crucial to attain good root yields by making better use of the available rainfall. There was a varietal effect on weevil infestation and Kaphulira was most affected. Weevil control is required for market-oriented producers to enhance the percentage of marketable roots. The average attainable fresh root yield ranged from 18 t ha(-1) for Zondeni to 32 t ha(-1) for Mathuthu, against actual yields of 5-9 t ha(-1). Elevation, planting date, rainfall and crop establishment could explain only 28 percent of the average yield gap, while 49 percent was explained for Mathuthu. Other factors that may explain the yield gap, but were not included in the model are: tillage methods and soil nutrient limitations. Male host farmers received better quality cuttings and planted in better soil moisture conditions, resulting in better establishment and vine yields. OFSP productivity can be enhanced through gender-sensitive extension, by ensuring male and female farmers can plant clean planting material of a suitable variety early in the rainy season. This requires additional efforts in vine multiplication of the required variety prior to the onset of the rains.},

	abstract = {Rearing of scavenging chickens is among the most commonly practiced farm activities in Ethiopia. This system is dominated by indigenous chickens. Output from indigenous chickens is low due to poor management and absence of intense selection that is intended to improve economically important traits. This showed that village chickens are rather evolved for adaptation traits. However, the level of risk is low, and this has made rearing of scavenging chickens a choice of farm activity for smallholder farmers. The objective of this study was to characterize the scavenging chickens' production system in Wolaita Zone. Single-visit survey involving individual interview of 119 farmers and 6 focus group discussions was used to collect the data. Our results showed that rearing of scavenging chickens was constrained especially by disease and predation problems. However, farmers proposed a set of solutions to minimize the effect of these problems. Rearing of scavenging chickens fulfils the multi-functional need of the society. This system has special features because it can sustain in its own without the need for modern commercial chicken farming facilities. However, farmers also reported the drawbacks of rearing of scavenging chickens and these mainly include uproot of garden crops and tiresomeness of the night watching. Selection of chickens was mainly depending on physically observed traits like body size and plumage colour. The initial foundation flock was mainly obtained from the local market. The ideal place for scavenging chickens production is the one that has intermediate weather condition and has some trees that can be used as shade; however, it was substantiated that it has to be free from bush and shrubs, weeds and wet lands. Therefore, these pieces of knowledge embedded among smallholder farmers need to be well documented and synthesized to design an appropriate type of technology packages that can be communicated back to farmers to improve productivity of the scavenging chickens.},

Field surveys to elicit farmers perceptions about climate variability and change were conducted in Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Mwingi and Mutomo districts. Long-term rainfall records from five meteorological stations within a 10 km radius from the survey locations were obtained from the Kenya Meteorological Department and were analysed to compare with farmers' observations. Farmers' responses indicate that they arc well aware of the general climate in their location, its variability, the probabilistic nature of the variability and the impacts of this variability on crop production. However, their ability to synthesize the knowledge they have gained from their observations and discern long-term trends in the probabilistic distribution of seasonal conditions is more subjective, mainly due to the compounding interactions between climate and other factors such as soil fertility, soil water and land use change that determine the climate's overall influence on crop productivity There is a general tendency among the farmers to give greater weight to negative impacts leading to higher risk perception. In chit ion to long-term changes in the climate, farmer observations in our study that rainfall patterns are changing corroborated well with reported perceptions from other places across the African continent but were not supported by the observed minds in rainfall data from the five study locations. The main implication of our findings is the need to be aware of and account for the risk during the development and promotion of technologies involving significant investments by smallholder farmers and exercise caution in interpreting farmers' perceptions about long-term climate variability and change.},

	abstract = {Agroforestry systems provide diverse ecosystem services that contribute to farmer livelihoods and the conservation of natural resources. Despite these known benefits, there is still limited understanding on how shade trees affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services at the same time and the potential trade-offs or synergies among them. To fill this knowledge gap, we quantified four major ecosystem services (regulation of pests and diseases; provisioning of agroforestry products; maintenance of soil fertility; and carbon sequestration) in 69 coffee agroecosystems belonging to smallholder farmers under a range of altitudes (as representative of environmental conditions) and management conditions, in the region of Turrialba, Costa Rica. We first analyzed the individual effects of altitude, types of shade and management intensity and their interactions on the provision of ecosystem services. In order to identify potential trade-offs and synergies, we then analyzed bivariate relationships between different ecosystem services, and between individual ecosystem services and plant biodiversity. We also explored which types of shade provided better levels of ecosystem services. The effectiveness of different types of shade in providing ecosystem services depended on their interactions with altitude and coffee management, with different ecosystem services responding differently to these factors. No trade-offs were found among the different ecosystem services studied or between ecosystem services and biodiversity, suggesting that it is possible to increase the provision of multiple ecosystem services at the same time. Overall, both low and highly diversified coffee agroforestry systems had better ability to provide ecosystem services than coffee monocultures in full sun. Based on our findings, we suggest that coffee agroforestry systems should be designed with diversified, productive shade canopies and managed with a medium intensity of cropping practices, with the aim of ensuring the continued provision of multiple ecosystem services.

	abstract = {We estimate the potential value of general circulation model (GCM)-based seasonal precipitation forecasts for maize planting and fertilizer management decisions at two semi-arid locations (Katumani and Makindu) in Southern Kenya. Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. October-February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions - representing upper and lower bounds of predictability - and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15-30\% of the average gross value of production and 24-69\% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. GCM predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24\% at Katumani and 9\% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the study's assumptions, despite high probability (25\% at Katumani, 34\% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts.

	abstract = {People and nature interact since millennia in forests worldwide, but current management strategies addressing these ecosystems often exclude local people from the decision-making process. This top-down approach is the cornerstone of conservation initiatives, particularly in highly threatened and fragmented forested ecosystems. In contrast, collaborative management involving the participation of local com-munities has increasingly contributed to conservation efforts globally. Here we ask how collaborative management would contribute to the conservation of a threatened, culturally important, and keystone tree species. We address this question in the Araucaria Forest System1 (AFS) in southern Brazil, where the main conservation strategy has been top-down based on restrictive use. Throughout the entire distribu-tion of AFS, we interviewed 97 smallholders about how they use and manage Araucaria angustifolia trees (araucaria). We integrated their Traditional Ecological Knowledge2 (TEK) with a literature review about the conservation status of Araucaria Forests to analyze potential outcomes of two alternative conservation models: top-down with restrictive use, and bottom-up with collaborative management. We identified the feedback mechanisms in each model, and how they dampen or self-reinforced critical processes for AFS resilience. Our models showed that a top-down strategy maintains forest cover resilient to illegal logging but at the cost of losing TEK (undermining socio-ecological resilience) and forest resilience to other external disturbances, such as climate change. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach based on successful collaborative management schemes may increase the general resilience of AFS, while preserving TEK, thus contributing to maintaining the entire social-ecological system. Our findings indicate how it is paramount to maintain TEK to conserve AFS in the long term through collaborative management. By including local actors in the governance of AFS, its resilience is reinforced, promoting forest expansion, maintenance of TEK, and participatory conservation.},

	abstract = {Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is the primary source of natural rubber, an important raw material for industrial and non-industrial products. Smallholders account for 85\% of global rubber production. This highlights the impact of increased volatility in global rubber prices on smallholders' livelihoods. Decision support systems have been widely applied in agriculture to address complex issues and maintain profitability in crop production. They can facilitate the improvement of production through enhanced farm management practices and the development of effective smallholder-oriented policies. However, little attention has been paid to the potential role of decision support systems can play in smallholder rubber production. Here, we conduct a two-part systematic literature review to identify the factors that influence rubber production and explore how they has been incorporated in the design of existing decision support systems. We discuss the current role of decision support systems in improving smallholder rubber production and identify the limitations and opportunities for future improvements. Despite being a smallholder crop, there is a paucity of research on the influence of social and institutional factors on rubber production. To date, decision support systems in rubber production have been focused on predicting growth and yield, assessing profitability and viability, evaluating alternative farm management practices under uncertainties, and formulating policies for sustainable rubber production. We identified three main limitations: (1) the extensive data requirement; (2) the lack of incorporation of social and institutional factors; and (3) the difficulty of communicating model results to smallholders. We developed a framework and suggest improvement strategies for the development of improved decision support systems in rubber production. This framework aims to enhance the decision-making process by the key stakeholders to improve smallholder rubber production.},

	abstract = {Mountain social-ecological systems (MtSES) are transforming rapidly due to changes in multiple environmental and socioeconomic drivers. However, the complexity and diversity of MtSES present challenges for local communities, researchers and decision makers seeking to anticipate change and promote action towards sustainable MtSES. Participatory scenario planning can reveal potential futures and their interacting dynamics, while archetype analysis aggregates insights from site-based scenarios. We combined a systematic review of the global MtSES participatory scenarios literature and archetype analysis to identify emergent MtSES archetypal configurations. An initial sample of 1983 rendered 42 articles that contained 142 scenarios within which were 852 `futures states'. From these future states within the scenarios, we identified 59 desirable and undesirable futures that were common across studies. These `common futures' were grouped into four clusters that correlated significantly with three social-ecological factors (GDP per capita, income inequality, and mean annual temperature). Using these clusters and their associated significant factors, we derived four MtSES scenario archetypal configurations characterized by similar key adaptation strategies, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. We called these archetypes: (1) “revitalization through effective institutions and tourism”; (2) “local innovations in smallholder farming and forestry”; (3) “upland depopulation and increased risk of hazards”; and (4) “regulated economic and ecological prosperity”. Results indicate risks to be mitigated, including biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, cultural heritage change, loss of connection to the land, weak leadership, market collapse, upland depopulation, increased landslides, avalanches, mudflows and rock falls, as well as climate variability and change. Transformative opportunities lie in adaptive biodiversity conservation, income diversification, adaptation to market fluxes, improving transport and irrigation infrastructure, high quality tourism and preserving traditional knowledge. Despite the uncertainties arising from global environmental changes, these archetypes support better targeting of evidence-informed actions across scales and sectors in MtSES.},

	abstract = {Conflict over natural resources is a widespread phenomenon in the global south. Trends in consumption, demographics, environmental degradation, and socio-political dynamics are exerting significant pressure on the availability and accessibility of natural resources. In many countries, the governance of land for commercial agricultural investment leads to conflict. Such conflicts are complex, and the drivers extend beyond resource scarcity to issues of access and competition. This paper is based on the results of field research on investments in large-scale Jatropha plantations for biofuel production in Ethiopia. A case study of a large-scale Jatropha plantation in eastern-central Ethiopia is used to reconstruct the history of a short-lived, large-scale biofuel development in Ethiopia, and to examine the processes and the reasons for its failure. Between 2006 and 2009, more than 400,000 ha of land were acquired for industrial biofuel development. Given the country's dependence on imported fossil fuels and the global rush for alternative energy sources, the Ethiopian government, not surprisingly, gave emphasis to investment in biofuel development, mainly through Jatropha plantation. However, after costly experimentation, the “miracle crop” did not deliver what had been promised. Instead, it dispossessed and displaced thousands of marginalized local smallholder agropastoralists, created conflict over water and land resources, and kept thousands of hectares of land out of production. In the end, the rhetoric of “Jatropha revolution” and promises of local and national development were never materialized; the government's ambitious biofuel strategy also failed to achieve its objectives. The main argument of this paper is that the failure of large-scale biofuel companies to fulfill their ambitious promises in Ethiopia is part of the general failure in the governance of large-scale commercial agriculture and misleading views toward, and unrealistic promises of, Jatropha investments. These negatively affected the livelihood of the local agropastoralists and their interactions with the companies, which caused instabilities and conflicts in the area. It is hoped that the findings of this research will contribute to knowledge production and policies on the governance of large-scale commercial agriculture.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to investigate how climatic, market and policy factors interact to determine food production in Togo. Specifically, we estimate acreage and yield response to market prices, weather and policy changes for maize and rice. Design/methodology/approach We use panel data estimators in a Seemingly Unrelated Regressions Equation (SURE) model with region-level data from the Food and Agriculture Organization statistics department and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US Department of commerce. Findings We found lower fertilizer price and higher grain price effects on maize acreage and yield. In addition, we found a positive effect of expected rice price on both its acreage and yield. As expected, rainfall during planting months has a significant impact on both maize (April) and paddy (May) acreage allocations. Similarly, total rainfall during the growing season has a positive impact on both maize and paddy yields. Moreover, recent agricultural policy initiative designed to boost domestic food production has significantly increased acreage and yield for maize, and yield for paddy, especially the strategy for agricultural growth. Research limitations/implications The dataset includes region-level observations from 1991 to 2012 which limits the observation span. However, we had enough variability in key variables to determine the estimated coefficients. Practical implications Although the dataset is limited in time (1991-2012) and uses national-level output prices, this investigation reveals that cropland allocation to maize and rice is sensitive to fertilizer and grain prices, weather expectations and policy interventions. These findings provide evidence for sustainable food production and productivity enhancement in Togo. Social implications Understanding drivers of cropland allocation and cereal yield contribute to better food security and poverty reduction in developing countries, especially Togo. Originality/value Prior to this study, little was known on the effect of price, climate and policy on cropland allocation in Togo. This investigation contributes significantly to filling this knowledge gap and provides insights for effective interventions.},

	abstract = {Aiming to translate resilience thinking theory into farming systems design practice, this paper examines fundamental properties of complex systems dynamics and their relation with the mechanisms that govern resilience and transformability in African smallholder agriculture. Agroecosystems dynamics emerge from the aggregation of diverse livelihood strategies in response to changes in the agroecosystem context, and are characterised by non-linearity, irreversibility, convergence/divergence and hysteresis. I examine a number of case studies from Africa to verify three guiding hypotheses in connection to the diversity of rural livelihood strategies: (1) diversity as alternative system regimes; (2) diversity as the result of transformability; (3) diversity determined by changing agricultural contexts. The hierarchy of constraints that determine the space for manoeuvring in agroecosystems is described through the analogy of the Matryoshka nesting dolls: each system level confines and is confined by their immediate suband supra-systems. Agricultural contexts, as defined by agro-ecological potential, demography and market connectivity are also dynamic and their trajectory can be described as shifts across stability domains. An example from Kenya shows that household diversity can be described as alternative system regimes, through hysteretic rather than continuous, reversible models. In some particular cases diversity emerges from divergent pathways that may have implied radical transformations in the past, as shown here for rural livelihoods in northern Cameroun. A comparative analysis of East African agroecosystems shows that thresholds in specific variables that may point to the existence of possible tipping points are rather elusive and largely site specific, requiring systematic categorisation of agricultural contexts. While agroecology needs to provide the knowledge base for the ecological intensification of smallholder landscapes, policy and market developments are needed to deal with the Matryoshka effect - or with interactions that are presumably panarchical in certain cases. Desirable shifts in farming systems can only be stimulated by working on both ends simultaneously. (c) 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Cordia africana and Albizia coriaria are the dominant tree species of smallholder farming systems in the Mt Elgon region of Uganda and have multiple uses in agroforestry systems. This study deployed six sap flow meters on stems of three selected trees each of C. africana and A. coriaria on-farm. The objective of the study was to assess the daily water use patterns of these agroforestry tree species at different times of the year. We measured the daily sap flow of these two species using the heat ratio method over a period of 18months. There was a significant main effect of the interaction between tree species and season on daily water use. The two species show contrasting patterns of seasonal water use across leaf shedding stages characterised by episodes of reverse flow in A. coriaria at specific periods of the year. We propose that reverse flows in A. coriaria were triggered by leaf shading while the zero flows in C. africana, which occurred during rainfall events, could have resulted from a lag phase, an indication that the two species may have different water-use strategies. Although C. africana uses 12-15l day(-1) and A. coriaria uses 20-32l day(-1) based on the study trees, C. africana generally uses 12\% more water than A. coriaria on a standardised daily basis. Albizia coriaria exhibited radial variation of sap velocities between the inner and outer thermocouples at different periods of measurement, a phenomenon worth investigating further. The leaf shedding patterns of the two trees provide an opportunity for maximising the temporal complementarities of agroforestry systems where these trees exist. This knowledge of C. africana and A. coriaria tree water use provides critical insight for developing successful long-term tree monitoring and management programs in agroforestry systems.},

	abstract = {Water adequacy is central to maximised agricultural production in irrigation schemes Smallholder Irrigation Schemes (SISs) are designed to distribute water efficiently, adequately and equitably. Water governance, defined as the institutions, processes, procedures, rules and regulations involved in water management, plays an important role in water allocation and subsequently water adequacy. The intersectoral institutions involved in water governance in SISs, i.e., government, Water User Associations (WUAs), Irrigation Management Committees (IMCs) and traditional authorities, interact to formulate and design policies for running SISs. However, multilevel interaction amongst the active stakeholders at multiple levels shapes policy and underlies SIS performance. This research aimed to investigate the impacts water governance had on adequacy of water in irrigation schemes and was premised on the hypothesis that governance had no effect on water adequacy. Water adequacy describes water supply relative to demand. Adequacy indicates whether the water delivery system supplies the required amount to a section in the irrigation scheme over a period of time (daily, monthly or seasonally). Two irrigation schemes, the Mooi-River Irrigation Scheme (MRIS) and Tugela Ferry Irrigation Scheme (TFIS) were used as case studies. A descriptive analysis showed that 86\% of the farmers in the TFIS had adequate water, whereas 24\% had water adequacy in the MRIS. A Binary Logit model was employed to investigate the factors that influence water adequacy among irrigators. The regression model identified eight statistically significant factors that influenced water adequacy: the irrigation scheme, location of plot within the scheme, training in water management, training in irrigation, SIS irrigators' knowledge about the government's aims, availability of water licences, payment of water fees and satisfaction with the irrigation schedule. The study concluded that governance factors had influence on water adequacy in the selected SISs. The implication is that stakeholders should make irrigators aware of government Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) policy and strategies. The study recommends that the SISs introduce rules, procedures and protocols to support irrigators to enhance scheme governance and lead to the realisation of government policies.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years, the multifunctionality of tropical mountain rural landscapes has been encouraged to enhance the provision of numerous commodities, as well as ecological and cultural services. However, globalization and neoliberal policies have boosted agricultural production for global markets and simultaneously marginalized fundamental rural activities related to self-supply agriculture. This trend has modified smallholder livelihoods from being mostly agricultural to becoming increasingly wage-labor oriented. This shift in household income feeds back to land use configuration and landscape function. We examined origins, development and current states of farmer livelihoods and associated land use and cover changes that occurred in a tropical watershed landscape of the Huasteca Potosina in Mexico between 1970 and 2009. For this purpose, we adopted the Drylands Development Paradigm (DDP) as our analytical framework (Reynolds et al., 2007). Based on aerial photographs and interviews applied to farmers and key stakeholders, we identified local, regional, national and international socio-economic and biophysical drivers that led to current livelihood diversification in several communities sharing the same watershed, and the extent and rate of land use change that has occurred over the past 40 years. We found an increasingly fragmented landscape with a diverse mosaic of land use types (citrus, sugarcane, milpa and secondary forests) yet increasingly dominated by citrus plantations. This reflects an intergeneration livelihood transition towards land use decisions driven by the interaction of diverse and contrasting rural development policies, changing markets, price fluctuations and extreme climatic events. We suggest that the diversity of livelihood strategies and land use types is dynamic and continuously in transition: this creates a complex and changing landscape. The watershed landscape has responded to global markets at the cost of local needs, knowledge systems and social networks. Thus, landscape multifunctionality, preservation of ecosystem services and human well being could be at stake under current trends of globalization and global environmental change.

	abstract = {The efficiency with which applied resources are utilized in sub-Saharan African cropping systems is especially critical as the resources are generally scarce. Research efforts to improve farm productivity increasingly focus on resource interactions and trade-offs operating at farm-scale. Farm-scale models that integrate summary models of the various subsystems (crops, livestock, household) are proposed to analyse the complexity of management systems. NUANCES-FIELD is a summary model of the crop/soil system that calculates seasonal crop production based on resource availability, capture and utilization efficiencies. A detailed mechanistic crop growth model, APSIM, was used to generate parameters and variables that can be introduced as descriptive functions in NUANCES-FIELD. To such end, we first parameterized and tested APSIM based on several field experiments carried out on different soil types in western Kenya farms where nitrogen and/or phosphorus were applied. The model was further configured to generate nitrogen and phosphorus response curves as a function of soil condition (carbon content, clay content, phosphorus-sorption characteristics) and the effects of alternative weed management scenarios in relation to labour availability. Nitrogen, phosphorus and rainfall capture efficiencies ranged between 0.22-0.85 kg kg(-1), 0.05-0.29 kg kg(-1) and 0.10-0.53 mm mm(-1), respectively, depending on soil nutrient and physical conditions. Variation in the integrated seasonal fraction of radiation intercepted (intFRINT) with plant density was adequately described by the function y = 0.058x + 0.11 within a range of 1.5-5.5 maize plants per m(2). Investigation of weed management using the APSIM model identified a weed-free period of at least five weeks from maize emergence for minimum yield loss from weed-crop competition. The simulation exercises confirmed that resource-use efficiencies sharply decrease on moving from relatively fertile fields `close' to the homestead towards degraded `remote' fields within the same farm, giving impetus to expedite the search for better targeted management strategies for spatially-heterogeneous farms.

	abstract = {The aquaculture sector in Bangladesh is an important employer and a significant source of foreign exchange. In addition, it contributes significantly to food security due to the role of fish in peoples' diets, the most important source of protein and micronutrients. However, infectious diseases represent an important barrier to sector development due to economic losses and vulnerability of smallholders. The aim of this study was to gain an overview of the impact of infectious diseases in the aquaculture sector, and to assess the usefulness and use of impact studies in decision making for animal health management and biosecurity governance in Bangladesh. A review of scientific and grey literature on infectious disease impact in different aquaculture systems was conducted and their methodologies and findings summarised. Subsequently, interviews with 28 stakeholders from the private and public sector were conducted to enquire about decision-making structures in animal health management. The data were analysed using the framework method to allow the development of themes, by using the information, experiences and opinions inductively obtained from interviewees, deductively through the reviewed literature. Results showed a substantial socio-economic impact of infectious diseases. The numerous stakeholders involved in the decision-making process explained that key barriers to effective aquaculture health management were insufficient resources to investigate and tackle infectious aquatic animal diseases, a dearth of legislation and capacity for disease surveillance, a reliance on reactive response, and a lack of impact and evidence-based approaches for prioritising problem-solving, commonly based on anecdotal evidence. Furthermore, communication among the multiple stakeholders involved was reported to be weak. This complex situation requires a multi-level response, which should span from strengthening the knowledge of farmers and professionals in the field to the improvement of surveillance and diagnostic systems. Improved systems along with evidence on disease impact could inform the prioritisation of diseases and resource allocation for disease control in Bangladesh. Further, this evidence needs to be used to advise decisions to have a true value, for which establishing and strengthening communication pathways and processes is critical to make systematic use of the information and improve animal health management. In the light of future threats to Bangladesh such as climate change, increasing population density and demand for animal source foods, it is crucial to strengthen animal health management systems to reduce livelihoods vulnerability, food insecurity and the likelihood of disease emergence.},

	abstract = {Use of mineral fertilizers is essential to enhance crop productivity in smallholder farming systems of Sub-Saharan Africa, but various studies have reported Mon-responsiveness' where application of inorganic fertilizers does not lead to satisfactory yield gains. This phenomenon is not well defined nor are its extent and causes well understood. In order to close these knowledge gaps, we assessed the effects of commonly recommended nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and/or potassium (K) fertilizer inputs on maize grain and soybean production on farmer fields across prevalent land slope and/or soil texture gradients (2 x 2 matrix) in four agroecosystems over two growing seasons. The extent of the problem in the two cropping systems was compared by decomposing frequency distributions into various ranges of fertilizer effect sizes that represent specific degrees of non-responsiveness and responsiveness. Key soil properties and rainfall variables for field trials were also determined to identify the factors that are limiting crop yield increases by mineral fertilizer input. Significant differences were found in mean fertilizer effect on crop productivity and frequency of non-responsiveness among the study areas and growing seasons, with some explicit contrasts between maize and soybean. The application of mineral fertilizers failed to increase maize yields by more than 0.5 t ha(-1) in up to 68 \% of farmer fields and soybean yields by more than 150 kg ha(-1) in up to 65 \% of farmer fields for specific study areas and/or growing seasons, while for others crop responses exceeded those levels. Unlike hypothesized, there were no consistent differences in crop fertilizer responses between the soil texture and land slope classes at any of the study sites. The variation in fertilizer effects on maize grain productivity across the study areas and growing seasons was most strongly related to the soil silt and clay content, and exchangeable cation balances of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and K, whereas fertilizer effects on soybean were most strongly influenced by the evenness in rainfall during growing seasons, and the soil silt content, extractable P, and ratio of total C and total N. Findings from our study emphasize that non-responsiveness by maize and soybean crops in African smallholder agroecosystems is dependent on multiple interacting factors, and requires careful scrutiny to ensure returns on investments.},

	abstract = {Current efforts to promote integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) for improved productivity of staple cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa have paid little attention to soil micronutrient deficiencies under smallholder farming. This has not only compromised yields, but also undermined the nutritional quality of harvested grains. To address this knowledge gap, a study was carried out over two cropping seasons in Hwedza district in eastern Zimbabwe to assess the added grain yield and nutritional benefits of zinc (Zn) fertilizer application to maize (Zea mays L) under different ISFM options. In all cases, Zn application resulted in added maize grain and quality benefits. Application of Zn (11 kg ha(-1)) in combination with organic nutrient resources (5 t ha(-1)), and mineral fertilizers (90 kg N ha(-1) and 26 kg P ha(-1)) gave the highest maize grain yields of up to 3.9 t ha(-1); which translated to 1.3 times more yield than under sole mineral NPK fertilizers. lathe subsequent season, there were significantly higher residual effects (2 t ha(-1)) from organic xZn combinations compared with sole mineral fertilizer treatments. Organic nutrient resources and Zn application significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) influenced maize grain P and Zn concentration, with cattle manure consistently producing the highest grain P concentrations of 0.44\%. Maize grain under combinations of mineral NPK, Zn and leaf litter gave the highest grain Zn concentration of up to 35 mg kg(-1). The Zn-based treatments increased grain Zn concentration and yield by 67 and 29\%, respectively, indicating that there was much more benefit in grain quality than just yield after external Zn application. Combined organic resource and Zn fertilization also resulted in a significant build up of plant available soil P and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extractable Zn. Concentrations of 7.4 mg P kg(-1) and 5.5 mg Zn kg(-1) were measured after application of organics, compared with initial values of 5.2 mg kg(-1) and 1.15 mg kg(-1), respectively. It was concluded that benefits of ISFM options currently promoted in smallholder farming systems in Zimbabwe are constrained by soil Zn deficiencies. Combining these ISFM options with Zn fertilizer formulations increased yields and grain quality of the staple maize, enhancing scope for agronomic fortification of maize to enhance human nutrition.

	doi = {10.3390/f10080619},
	abstract = {Land use transformation at the farm level is attributed to household decision-making, reflected by the behavior and activities of smallholder farmers. Unfortunately, household decision-making in local communities and its determinants are site-specific and hardly understood. This study uses multistage purposive selection of households as a unit for the analysis to investigate the transformation from pure agriculture to farm forest mosaics, especially through woodlot establishment. We use key informants, household surveys, and observations to obtain data on decision-making amongst 84 farm households in Nyantonzi parish, Masindi district, Uganda, as an example. Specifically, the study addresses four research questions. Firstly, what is the current status of gender-based decision-making at the household level? Secondly, is decision making within farm households individualistic or collective? Thirdly, which factors are considered to select annual, perennial and tree-crop farm management regimes? Fourthly, what determinants influence the decision-making process and the likelihood of woodlot establishment? A multilevel analysis comprising parametric statistical models and binary logistic regression is applied to assess difference in household natural, physical, human, and social capital, highlight gender roles, and obtain factors associated to selection of crops and determinants of woodlot establishment at the farm level, respectively. Results reveal that gender based decision-making is clearly disaggregated on the basis of husbands and wives and it is individualistic, mostly dominated by husbands with lower participation by wives and other family members. Households consider various factors before making any decisions, e.g., market prices for both annual and perennial crops, food consumption for annual crops, ease of management, and yields from the previous season for the tree-crop management regimes. The likelihood for woodlot establishment is positively influenced by the willingness and intention of households to establish woodlots and relative age of household head. However, knowledge of land use Policies, Laws, and Regulations (PLRs) in relation to tree planting and harvesting and access to non-farm income reduce the likelihood of woodlot establishment. Here, we recommend that current and future forest land restoration initiatives focus on reducing the gender gap and increase women's participation in decision making, provide market information platforms on wood products, and include woodlot farmers in social organization. Current PLRs on tree tenure should be improved and clearly communicated by using the existing communication assets and social gatherings as channels of change and influence for decision-making.},

	abstract = {Intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) is one of the widely used practices of producing food crops on smallholder farms in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, the knowledge on the options toward intensification of available practices in order to optimize systems productivity using intercrops is generally lacking. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of intercropping, cropping seasons, and different varieties of common bean on productivity of the maize-common bean based intercrop through 5 cropping seasons from 2015 to 2017. Experimental site is located at 03 degrees 18'03.74' S and 37 degrees 12'13.94' E and an altitude of 956 m above sea level in the northern highlands of Tanzania. Hybrid maize Dekalb brand (DK 8031) and two varieties of common bean (improved Lyamungu 90 and local Mkanamna) were used. The treatments within a replicate were: (1) sole crops: (i) maize, (ii) local bean, (iii) improved bean, and (2) intercrops: (i) maize + local bean, (ii) maize + improved bean. Interaction and individual effects of cropping seasons (S) (periods of years - short and long rains), varieties of common bean (V), and cropping systems (C) (sole and intercrop) were studied. Results indicated that S x V interaction was significant on bean grain yield and 100seed weight. Improved bean outweighed the local bean with grain yields ranging from 2.2-3.5 t ha(-1) and 0.2-2.5 t ha(-1), respectively. The effect of S was significant on all measured variables in beans and the effect of M was only significant on total biomass. Further, S significantly affected all measured variables in maize and grain yields ranged from 2.3-2.6 t ha(-1). In maize, correlations were strong (r = 0.48*; P = 0.0325) between maize grain yield and ground coverage of leaf canopy measured 42-56 days after sowing. The land equivalent ratios (LERs) for maize intercropped with improved and local beans were 1.48 and 1.55, respectively but LER values did not differ significantly between bean varieties. In this study, both common bean varieties were sown simultaneously with the maize, which might have resulted in their differential performance. It is recommended that studies are conducted to evaluate time of introducing this legume crop to a maize system such as early sowing, sowing mid in the season after a maize crop is well established, and sowing late in the season when the leaves in maize plant have started to senesce.},

	abstract = {This article assesses the interactions between participation in Malawi's largest public works programme, the Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF), and three widely promoted climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices. Drawing on three waves of national panel household survey data, we find that participation in MASAF significantly increases the probability that farm households adopt the resource intensive CSA practices of building soil water conservation structures and applying organic fertilizers. Moreover, participation in MASAF contributes to a sustained adoption of these practices over multiple agricultural seasons. We empirically demonstrate that the standalone impact of the CSA practices on maize productivity and the value of crops harvested under normal and dry conditions is, in most cases, not significantly different from zero. However, we find a reduction in sensitivity to low precipitation when MASAF participation occurs in the previous agricultural season. Moreover, the joint treatment effect of MASAF participation with sustained adoption of soil water conservation structures substantially increases households' productivity and welfare. This synergistic benefit is likely driven by the transfer of skills learned during MASAF public works to farmers' own fields. Results suggest that the CSA agenda can be enhanced by explicitly integrating existing social protection interventions with the promotion of CSA practices. (c) 2021.

	abstract = {In much of sub-Saharan Africa, soil quality heterogeneity hampers farmer learning about the returns to different inputs. This may help explain why relatively few farmers in the region use improved inputs. We study how Kenyan farmers respond to an interactive app that enables them to discover the returns to different inputs on a virtual farm that is cal-ibrated to resemble their own. Farmers update both their beliefs and their behaviors after engaging with the virtual learning app. We measure beliefs by eliciting probability dis-tributions and use an incentive-compatible experiment to measure behavior change. The experiment gave participants an input budget that they could allocate across farm inputs. After playing several virtual seasons on the app, they could update these allocations. Farm-ers revise their input allocations along several dimensions after the virtual learning expe-rience. To support our interpretation that these adjustments stem from real learning, we show that farmers with the highest predicted returns to lime-an unfamiliar input in this region-increase their lime orders more than others. Our results suggest that engagement with a personalized virtual platform can induce real learning and enhance farmers' beliefs and technology choices. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Climate change such as extreme weather, unexpected temperature and rainfall fluctuations cause several significant risks to the agro-economy. This study, therefore, assessed the determinants of climate change perception (CCP), the level of perception and its impact on net farm income of rice farmers. This is imperative as the actual CC communication and policy, therefore, require a good understanding of smallholders' views and acknowledgment of individual's perception about CC. Employing cross-sectional data from 360 rice farmers selected from three States in South-West, Nigeria, a Ricardian model was used to analyse climate change impact on rice production. While accounting for selection bias, the study employed a double-hurdle (DH) model to estimate the determinants of farmers' perception of climate change. The results of DH estimation model show that location, access to credit, educational level and household size of the farmers are statistically significant factors influencing climate change perception (CCP). The result from the second hurdle shows that the perceived intensity of climate change was influenced by farm size, farming experience, marital status and educational level of smallholder rice farmers. The Ricardian model's result shows that farmers' income is influenced by CCP and their socio-economic characteristics. The results further indicate that smallholder rice farmers' net farm income is sensitive to marginal changes in both temperature and precipitation. Thus, this study recommends that government policies and investment strategies should be geared towards the support of education and the improvement of farmers' cooperatives, credit facilities and information about climate change, particularly in respect of smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The recommended improvements are imperative for food security. Investment in farmer training programmes is essential for development and may also be a panacea for improving the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies with the overall goal of increasing productivity.},

	issn = {0308-521X},
	doi = {10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103179},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: High price volatility in agricultural commodities can be a major issue for value chain actors exposed to its adverse economic impacts. Price volatility results from the interaction of multiple factors linked within dynamic and complex agricultural systems. Therefore, to address price volatility, the approach needs to be capable of analysing feedback that occurs in such complex systems. OBJECTIVE: We integrate a systems thinking approach and value chain analysis to overcome the constraint of other methods to explicitly describe and understand how system structure influences system behaviour observed in price volatility and the assessment of the consequences of ex-ante and ex-post policy interventions based on this understanding. METHODS: The proposed integrated approach involves the active participation of value chain actors and stakeholders to improve their understanding of the complex systems they operate within including the policy environment. The approach takes the Indonesian chilli value chain as a case study. We implemented the first two steps of systems thinking (i.e., articulating problems and formulating dynamic hypotheses). In the group model building processes, we developed causal loop diagrams to represent a dynamic hypothesis that explains the feedback loops that cause price oscillation behaviour and systems archetypes that identify potential intervention points. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: The integrated approach was able to link the Indonesian chilli value chain's system structure and the system behaviour observed in price volatility. The causal loop diagram clearly displays the feedback between production, market governance, consumption, and price. The diagram also portrays how these factors impact value chain actors' performance and the influence of time delays and random shocks on the entire value chain system. Limits to growth and shifting the burden archetypes were identified as critical leverage points in formulating fundamental policy interventions to address price volatility. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the strengths of the proposed approach in developing a comprehensive dynamic qualitative model of a whole value chain system that influences the system behaviour, such as oscillation, which other modelling studies do not consider. The use of system archetypes to identify intervention points is another research contribution in that it improves value chain analysis. The results also highlight the benefits of participatory system dynamics modelling in enhancing the learning of value chain actors in anticipating the consequences of any actions or random shocks on the entire systems.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105382},
	abstract = {Inclusive innovation as a strategy for inclusive development has received increased attention from development policymakers, practitioners, and scholars in recent years. What these processes entail in practical terms, however, remains contested and under-theorized. This paper addresses the scarcity of mid-level analysis and models of inclusive innovation processes within complex systems, which are needed to enable a coherent empirical research agenda and to inform program theory-building, implementation, and evaluation. Looking to smallholder-oriented agricultural systems in the Global South, where the majority of inclusive innovation implementation and research has been located, this paper proposes that it is possible to identify the essential features and causal logic of these processes to create an empirically-derived, middle-range model with cross-context applicability. Drawing on methods from realist evaluation and social inquiry, I conducted a theory-driven, cross-case synthesis of three studies of inclusive innovation processes in agricultural systems, with one case each from South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. I find that despite significant diversity in project designs, facilitation approaches, and local contexts, the three inclusive innovation processes unfolded in strikingly similar ways, and that this modus operandi can be modeled as a middle-range theory of change. In each case, I find that a consistent set of activities and processes changed the local context for the inclusive innovation initiative. These altered contextual factors interacted with ongoing programmatic activities in consistent ways to trigger processes of social learning, social capital strengthening, collective cognition, and consensus formation, which acted as causal mechanisms responsible for producing the intermediate outcomes that led to technical, organizational, and institutional system innovation. The middle-range model enables cross-context insights into how inclusive innovation processes work and what capacities are needed to facilitate them. It can also guide the adaptive management and assessment of these processes, while offering testable hypotheses to guide future empirical work and evaluation. (C) 2021 The Author.

	doi = {10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06403},
	abstract = {Food insecurity caused by climate change has become one of the main issues on the global agenda. Worldwide, the importance of digital tools as a means to enhance adaptive capacity and resilience of smallholder farmers (SHFs) in the face of climate variability has long been recognised. Technology-based systems in agriculture frequently neglect to consider the actual context of use and adoption by SHFs in rural and developing contexts. These conditions, as pointed out in the literature, range from high “illiteracy” rates to poor technology infrastructure to a requirement for smartphone-based technology of which very few SHFs in the developing world can take advantage. However, very little is known about the information and communication technology (ICT) literacy levels of SHFs in general in terms of supporting them in their farming decisions. This paper, therefore, explores the ICT literacy levels of Msinga SHFs in order to understand what could enhance their use and adoption of ICT for weather forecasting. Msinga is a hotspot for climate change. Consequently, the means of livelihood of the SHFs in this municipality have been negatively impacted. Volunteering sampling was used, in which 35 SHFs were purposively selected from a population of 100 SHFs who belong to the Asisukume Msinga Agricultural Cooperative (AMAC) - all irrigation farmers. A sequential transformative mixed method design, embedded in an Indigenous research framework, was employed. This paper reports on the quantitative aspects of the study which addressed the following two research questions: (i) What are Msinga SHFs ICT literacy capability levels? and (ii) What is the relationship between SHFs ICT levels and their demographic data w.r.t. their adoption of ICT tools in their agricultural practices? Data were collected using a demographic details questionnaire (examining age, marriage, educational level, and years of farming experience) and an assessment of ICT literacy (assessing 5 ICT literacy skills which included mobile phone symbol identification to advanced ICT literacy). Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, specifically the use of Spearman rank-order correlation using IBMO Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSSO), version 20. The results suggest that for the ICT literacy levels, SHFs were not able to display use of the various ICT relatedskills, with the exception of ICT levels 1 and 2 where satisfactory display of ICT literacy were displayed among most of the SHFs. When examining the associations between ICT literacy levels and the demographic variables, significant negative associations were found between the ICT literacy levels and age as well as years of experience, while significant positive associations were found between ICT literacy levels and educational level. The results, furthermore, suggest that marital status has no correlation with ICT literacy proficiency. The findings arising from this study highlight the “importance of context” in helping SHFs to mitigate the threats of climate change on food production, an issue that is completely ignored in curriculum policies and policies aimed at integrated national adaptation responses to climate change impact and vulnerability.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim: Classical swine fever (CSF) is one of the primary diseases in animals in Indonesia, particularly areas that supply pig meat to the country, such as Karanganyar district, Central Java. The government has tried to prevent and control the disease by vaccination, but it has not yet given effective results. Therefore, another attempt to prevent the recurrence of CSF cases is to apply biosecurity in pig farms by looking for risk factors associated with on-farm and off-farm contact. This study aims to determine the contact rate and investigate the risk factors associated with on-farm and off-farm contact in commercial and smallholder pig farms in Karanganyar, Central Java, Indonesia, in the context of controlling CSF disease. Materials and Methods: This study used a cross-sectional study design in which the pig farm was designed as the observed epidemiological unit. The contact structure data were conducted by sampling using a two-stage random method. We selected Karanganyar district because it is the center of a pig farm in the Central Java Province and has many CSF cases in several years before. The study was conducted for more or less 1 month from August to September 2019. The contact data were collected from 37 smallholder farms and 27 commercial farms within interviews. Risk factors for contact with pigs were analyzed using logistic regression using the Statistix Program version 8.0 (www.statistix.com). Results: In comparison to smallholder farms, commercial farms had 2.38 and 3.32 times higher contact rate in outside farms and inside farms, respectively. Two factors increased the risk for on-farm contacts including commercials type farm (p=0.0012; odds ratio [OR]=8.32) with contact rate of 1.24 times/day and the time interval of CSF vaccination for 1-3 months (p=0.0013; OR=8.43) with contact rate of 0.98 times/day, and three factors increased the risk for off-farm contacts including the commercial farm type (p=1012; OR=4.88) with 1.50 contact/day, the time interval of CSF vaccination for 1-3 months (p=0.036; OR=3.83) with 1.30 contact/day, and farmers with experience in pig husbandry {\textless}5 years (p=0.075; OR=3.56) with 1.13 contact/day. Conclusion: This study shows that commercial farms and short CSF vaccination intervals increased the risk of either off-farm or on-farm contacts. The contact structure of pig farms in Karanganyar district is similar to that in other areas in Indonesia. Reducing the risk of contacts either outside or inside the pig farms is essential to prevent disease transmission. Enhancing communication and education to pig farmers and surveillance is also necessary to prevent such diseases in pigs.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers face many constraints to achieving food security. Optimal soil management is often limited by a lack of accessible and accurate soil characterization, and an associated lack of soil-specific management practice recommendations. Crop yields depend on both soil quality and soil-mediated fertilizer responses. Existing research on soil-fertilizer interactions is primarily based on farm trials and/or survey data, which are resource intensive and typically restricted to local scales. High-resolution (similar to 10-meter) remote sensing data and digital soil maps provide a low cost, scalable alternative. Here, we deploy methods based on the Sentinel satellite constellation to estimate soil and fertilizer impacts on irrigated wheat grain yields in Nepal and to inform precision soil and nutrient management recommendations. We first combine field data with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel 2 imagery to delineate wheat cropping areas for 2016-2019 with 92 \% accuracy. We then estimate wheat yields at 10-meter resolution using Sentinel-2 and weather covariates based on yield models parameterized from two different methods: 1) APSIM crop model simulations and 2) ground cropcuts from 147 fields. Using a large dataset of soil samples collected by the Nepal Agricultural Research Council, we examine the linear and nonlinear effects of soil properties on wheat yields. Finally, the soil maps were combined with a survey of field level crop management data and our yield estimates to test the interaction of soil quality with fertilizer effectiveness. Our ground-calibrated satellite model predicted yields with good accuracy (R-2 = 0.55), while the uncalibrated simulation-based approach had weaker but significant prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.24). We find statistically significant gains in yield of 0.9-2.4 \% are possible by increasing soil organic matter and zinc from highly deficient values to optimal values of 2.2 \% organic matter (OM) and 0.67 ppm zinc (Zn). Using digital soil maps of Nepal produced by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), we map croplands deficient in zinc (Zn {\textless} 0.66 ppm) and organic matter (OM {\textless} 2.2 \%) and find that 72 \% of croplands in the Nepal Terai are experiencing less than optimal levels of these nutrients. We examine the effectiveness of nitrogen and zinc fertilizers, applied in amounts ranging from 0 to 150 kg ha(-1) and 0 to 15 kg ha(-1) respectively, in different soil quality regimes as determined by a soil quality index informed by standard relationships between crop yields and soil properties. Yields were significantly more responsive to zinc fertilizer inputs in soils with a higher than average soil quality but responded similarly to nitrogen inputs across different soils. Effects of soil and fertilizers on the simulation-based yield estimate were generally similar but less significant than effects on ground-calibrated yields. Overall, nitrogen and zinc increased ground-calibrated yields by 0.8 and 10.4 kg ha(-1) per kg of nutrient input, respectively. This research demonstrates the potential of satellite data, crop simulation, and machine learning to examine the influence of soils on yields and guide precision fertilizer use in smallholder regions.},

Rural households mitigate risks through both individual and collective strategies that have proven viable for establishing long-term adaptive capacities. However, while the importance of social interactions has been acknowledged, there has been little in-depth empirical research on the influence of collective structures on vulnerable livelihoods. Based on research with smallholders in rural Vietnam, this paper explores how social capital deployed through informal collective actions compares with the effects of formal collective organisations for the overall adaptive capacity. We apply a mixed-methods approach combining a rich survey dataset from three rural provinces, and qualitative interviews with farmers in four case study villages. The results reveal the emergence of informal and semi-formalised collective actions in farming practices as synergistic supplements to existing formal structures and institutions through mechanisms of social learning.},

	abstract = {The combined and interacting effects of land-use change, resource extraction and climate change threaten the sustainability of millions of mainly smallholder farms in tropical agroforested landscapes. In many of these landscapes, coordinated action among stakeholders at landscape level would help to address challenges such as pests and diseases, price crises and climate change. However, methods to facilitate the co-production of sustainable landscape management in such complex multi-stakeholder systems are currently largely lacking. In this paper, we present a novel approach to explore pathways for the sustainability transition of agroforestry systems. By combining participatory forecasting and backcasting approaches, based on serious games and future vision development, we explore relevant agroforestry management strategies for reaching sustainable future coffee-based agroforestry landscapes. We focused our research on the challenges faced in the main coffee-producing area in Nicaragua. Here, we organized five participatory game sessions to explore farmer decision-making processes, farming strategies and to develop new networks and stimulate social learning among farmers. In the associated backcasting workshop, the most influential game session participants joined technicians, researchers and municipality officials to collectively envision sustainable future landscape management. In all game sessions, farmers developed diversified coffee-based agroforested landscapes characterised by increased density and diversity of shade trees, for the purpose of income diversification as well as forest conservation. During the backcasting workshop, the participants identified policy instruments and community-based solutions for the transition to sustainable landscapes. Our participatory approach facilitated discussion on landscape planning among farmers and other stakeholders and allowed the outline of a pathway towards the collective envisioned future landscape. The combination of participatory forecasting and backcasting proved to be a helpful tool to support multi-stakeholder processes towards sustainable landscape management in this and other complex landscapes.},

It recognises the contribution of ES supporting and resulting from smallholder livestock and poultry production, but also details the limiting factors or EDS, such as tick-borne disease, birds of prey or unpalatable rangeland, produced by the same system. Using a mixed-methods approach, including focus group discussions with various Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) activities, key informant interviews, household surveys and land-use change mapping on GIS, we consider the relative value and benefits from ES after the effects of EDS, as well as the management and strategies that households adopt to minimise EDS. The effects of ES and EDS were expressed in economic terms to provide a common framework to assess the magnitude of their contribution or effect. Although animal husbandry made measurable contributions to households, with an average gross value of between R2605-R9753 across villages, EDS undermined the meaningful production of livestock and poultry goods and services. The average EDS-induced economic loss in households was between R8289-R22,426 per annum. Despite active management, often at substantial cost to the household, EDS undermined the health of livestock which resulted in a loss of the animal or potential goods and services produced. We emphasise the need to recognise both the positive and negative contributions of ecosystems to identify the complex feedbacks between ES and EDS which interact to determine local ways of doing things.},

	abstract = {Developing a conceptual model is vital for small-scale organic farmer's credit access to sustain the livelihoods. However, smallholders continually face severe problems in getting finance that lead to reduce investment and in turn, challenges the livelihoods. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to establish and empirically test a theoretical model to explore how agility and innovativeness in organic food value chain finance are achieved through ITI, TRST, CG, ICT, and IS, and how these, in turn, can accelerate financial flow in the value chain and enhance competitiveness. The present study used a survey method and collected data from small-scale farmers, traders, and financial institutions. The model and hypothesis are tested using data obtained from 331 respondents through partial least square structure equation modeling techniques. We argue that development of theoretical model show potential to increase creditworthiness of smallholders and overcome uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangement. Thus, the present study could provide new ways to integrate the value chain partners, through information and communication technology and governance arrangements in the organic food value chain financing. This study demonstrates that the mediations of innovativeness and agility significantly affect the development of new financial products to make agile the financial flow, which in turn positively influences value chain competitiveness. Significant judgments are required for trustworthy relations among the value chain partners to positively harness innovative product development for swifter value chain finance. Therefore, this theoretical model should not be regarded as a quick solution, but a process of testing, error, and learning by doing so.},

	abstract = {Understanding broiler farmers' intention toward highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) control is important to design successful HPAI control programs. We used Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to identify factors (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) associated with the intentions of Western-Java small-scale broiler farmers toward implementing cleaning and disinfection (C\&D), vaccination, reporting, and stamping-out without or with 50\% compensation. For this, 203 Western-Java farmers were interviewed. The majority of the farmers had a positive intention to implement C\&D (89\%), reporting (88\%), and vaccination (80\%). A lower number had a positive intention to join stamping-out both with 50\% compensation (67\%) and without any compensation (53\%). Farmers had a more positive attitude and subjective norm, but lower perceived behavioral control toward one or more of the intentions to implement measures. Attitude was positively associated with intentions to implement C\&D and vaccination. Subjective norm of veterinarians of integrated companies was positively associated with intentions to implement vaccination. Perceived behavioral control (i.e., money and time) was positively associated with intentions to implement C\&D, vaccination, and stamping-out without any compensation. Results suggest that farmers are in favor of implementing preventive measures (i.e., C\&D and vaccination) on HPAI control over facing the consequences of control measures (i.e., stamping-out), and HPAI control programs should primarily focus on incentivizing farmers complemented by programs aiming to improve farmers' attitude. Thus, policy should be emphasized to preventive measures rather than control measures. Financial incentive-based instruments (e.g., price and performance bonus) can be used to increase the intention of farmers to implement C\&D and vaccination. Trained vaccinators might help to save the time needed to vaccinate the entire flock can increase the intention of farmers to vaccinate their chickens. Also, informational instruments (e.g., education and communication) can be used to change and to improve the attitude of farmers to implement both measures.},

	abstract = {In the western highlands of Guatemala, the indigenous population is one of the most marginalized communities. The food security of subsistence and infrasubsistence smallholders within this population still relies on domestic agricultural production as the principal livelihood activity and the main source of food. Smallholder production systems in the region are complex, with multiple interacting subsystems functioning at different integration levels and with different temporal dynamics. Previous results, based on a data set of nearly 5,000 farm households using a robust food availability indicator (that quantifies agricultural production, consumption, transformation, and commercialization of produce), have shown large differences in food security between farmers in the western highlands of Guatemala. Another important finding was that more than half of the farm households do not have the means to produce enough energy for home consumption from their agricultural activities. Identifying the constraints, patterns, and underlying processes driving food security could give rise to a set of easy-to-measure variables that quickly and reliably assess household food security status; such a tool would be helpful for decision and policy makers trying to focus on actions more likely to succeed in improving food security in the region. In this study, we developed a predictive model of food security, through the application of machine learning techniques, to identify the most important factors, and their interactions, which account for variability in food security. The resulting “artificial neural network” model performed well, explaining nearly 85\% of the variance in food security status. By applying different sensitivity analysis methods, we were able to detect highly non-linear interactions between the different factors driving food security. Land availability per person is detected as the main constraint for attaining food security. The median value of land availability per person in the region is 0.085 ha, explaining why 52\% of the farm household population does not produce enough food energy from agriculture. Many other interactions were found between crop land allocation, diversity, yields, and food security, which can help to target interventions to improve the food security status in the region.},

More specifically, we adopt BWS to provide an update on constraints that limit the participation of Kenyan horticultural smallholder farmers in modern agricultural value chains. In addition to traditional constraints posed by input market failures and missing institutions, we considered constraints such as trust and familiarity with buyers shown by recent empirical studies to inform smallholders' market choices. Ascertaining the relevance of these constraints highlights our contribution to the existing literature. We find that farmers consistently rate access to high-quality inputs as their main constraint followed by concerns about access to credit, the high cost of meeting food standards, missing cooperatives, and exploitative intermediaries. Respondents considered insufficient labor, small farmlands, and weak tenure rights as the least important constraints. Age, location, gender, household income, and education influence the relative importance various segments of smallholders place on these constraints. For example, constraints are economic rather than personal for low-income farmers. Counterintuitively, rural smallholders are less likely to perceive poor transportation network as a constraint. Smallholders' distrust of buyers they interact with is informed by their location and income. In designing intervention initiatives, policies that focus on segments of smallholders are needed for improving smallholder participation in modern agricultural value chains.},

With a study of smallholder farming communities in central Kenya, we examine factors affecting the likelihood of Kenyan farmers' adoption of m-services specifically related to agriculture and livestock information, buying and selling products, and alerts about agricultural or livestock activities. According to a survey of 577 farming households, 98\% of respondents own a mobile phone. Approximately 25\% use it to access information about agriculture and livestock, 23\% access information about buying and selling products, and 18\% receive alerts. Personal smartphone ownership increases the likelihood of m-services use (p {\textless} .001), as does membership in farmer organizations (p {\textless} .001). We find that age and income are not significantly related to m-service use, and we discuss this result in terms of intersections between smartphone ownership, gender, and education. Consistent with prior qualitative research, our quantitative results further support the need for m-services providers to design for basic or feature phone users for improved dissemination of agro-meteorological information.},

Farmer-preferred and efficient strategies were identified through participatory modelling. The farmers' basin irrigation and scheduling (I), farmers' scheduling with furrow strategy (II), farmers' scheduling with alternate furrow strategy (III) and scheduling at 55\% maximum allowable depletion (MAD) (IV) were evaluated for maize (Zea mais) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) using the FAO AquaCrop model. The results showed that I resulted in over-irrigation for maize and under-irrigation for barley, while IV resulted in maximum yield (8.6 t ha(-1) for maize and 2 t ha(-1) for barley) with maximum (1.8 kg m(-3)) and minimum (0.8 kg m(-3)) water productivity of maize under IV and I, respectively. A shift from I to IV (most preferred strategy by farmers) can save 8440 mm of water, which can possibly bring back 18.5 ha of land into irrigation. It is essential to interact with farmers on a basis of mutual comprehension to increase their trust and to lay a base for discussion, awareness raising and decision making. The transdisciplinary approach, Community of Practice (CoP) and Learning Practice Alliance (LPA) were appropriate platforms for participation.

	abstract = {Heterogeneous crop identification has been the subject of much concern, since smallholder farms less than 1 ha are the main agricultural form in many areas, especially China. Remote sensing with high spectral and spatial resolutions via aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides a potential alternative technique for the monitoring of heterogeneous crops in smallholder agriculture. Although this new type of remote sensing data with high spectral and spatial resolutions provides the possibility of fine classification, it also brings some challenges, such as bands contaminated with severe noise, the nonuniform distribution of the discriminative spectral information, and the spectral variability of crops. In this study, we attempted to resolve these problems by developing a robust spectral-spatial agricultural crop mapping method based on conditional random fields (SCRF), which learns the sensitive spectral information of the crops by a spectrally weighted kernel, and uses the spatial interaction of pixels to improve the classification performance. Data from a manned aircraft platform and a UAV platform were chosen to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can effectively use the relative utility of each spectral band to detect the bands contaminated with severe noise, and it uses the spectrally weighted kernel to consider the sensitive spectral information of the crops. The algorithm with only a spectrally weighted kernel showed an improvement of more than 4\% over the classical support vector machine and random forest methods. Moreover, the spatial information was proved to be of crucial importance for crop classification, and both the object-oriented method and the proposed SCRF method can improve the classification performance in terms of both visualization and the quantitative metrics by considering the spatial information. Compared with the object-oriented method, SCRF can deliver a better classification performance, with an accuracy improvement of more than 2\%.},

	abstract = {A recent coffee leaf rust epidemic has generated a severe fall in Coffea arabica production throughout Mexico and Central America. This paper analyzes the social-ecological crisis presented by the Hemileia vastatrix outbreak, with a focus on how global, regional and national dynamics interact with local processes in the Chiapas Sierra Madre of south-eastern Mexico, a biodiversity hotspot with a tradition of smallholder, shade-grown coffee production. We explore the hypothesis that the current coffee rust epidemic is an expression of global environmental change, with implications for legal frameworks and international efforts towards risk management and climate change adaptation. Addressing debates on legal resilience building, we illustrate how mismatches of scale between social-ecological phenomena and legal and institutional arrangements may generate pathological solutions for small-scale coffee producers and shade-grown coffee ecosystems. Thereafter, using the analytical lens of modularity, the paper sheds light on landscape stewardship to reduce the risks of non-resilient characteristics such as isolation, on the one hand, and on the other, over-connectedness of habitat patches in the landscape of importance for ecosystem functions at larger scales. The interdisciplinary framework leads to recognizing the role of institutions and legal arrangements which are not limited to national boundaries in proposing solutions to this social-ecological crisis. We find that matching scales of law with agroforestry systems can be done through a variety of legal and policy instruments to contribute to resilience building. This matching of scales is vital to safeguarding biodiversity's global benefits and the right of small-scale coffee farmers to a healthy and sustainable environment.},

Several machine learning approaches were used in this study to investigate the relative influences of multiple biophysical, socio-economic, and crop management features in determining maize yield variability using several machine learning approaches. Soil fertility status was assessed in 180 farms and paired with the surveyed data on maize yield, socio-economic conditions, and agronomic management. The C\&RT relative variable importance plot identified farm size, total labor, soil factors, seed rate, fertilizer, and organic manure as influential factors. Among the three approaches compared for classifying maize yield, the artificial neural network (ANN) yielded the least (25\%) misclassification on validation samples. The random forest partial dependence plots revealed a positive association between farm size and maize productivity. Nonlinear support vector machine boundary analysis for the eight top important variables revealed complex interactions underpinning maize yield response. Notably, farm size and total labor synergistically increased maize yield. Future research integrating these algorithms with empirical crop growth models and crop simulation models for ex-ante yield estimations could result in further improvement.},

Challenges relating to how to improve irrigation are multi-factor and multisectoral, and they involve a broad range of actors who must interact to reach decisions collectively. We provide a systematic reflection on findings from the research project EAU4Food, which adopted a transdisciplinary approach to irrigation for food security research in five case studies in Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, South Africa and Tunisia. The EAU4Food experiences emphasize that actual innovation at irrigated smallholder farm level remains limited without sufficient improvement of the enabling environment and taking note of the wider political economy environment. Most project partners felt at the end of the project that the transdisciplinary approach has indeed enriched the research process by providing different and multiple insights from actors outside the academic field. Local capacity to facilitate transdisciplinary research and engagement with practitioners was developed and could support the continuation and scaling up of the approach. Future projects may benefit from a longer time frame to allow for deeper exchange of lessons learned among different stakeholders and a dedicated effort to analyse possible improvements of the enabling environment from the beginning of the research process.

Although farmers are producing more surplus vegetables, they are not much linked with markets and thus their opportunity to diversify their livelihoods from vegetable production is very much limited. Thus, this study was required to identify factors affecting market participation among smallholder vegetable farmers in southwest Ethiopia. To get the sample respondents two-stage sampling procedures were employed and finally, 240 vegetable producers were selected. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from primary and secondary sources. To achieve the stated objective probit model was used and its result indicates that age of household head, household family size, education level of household head, labour market, market information and distance from the market place were statistically influencing market participation among smallholder vegetable producers. To enable smallholder's participation in vegetable marketing government interventions is needed to strengthening institutional service, communication and infrastructure facilities. This study may be valuable input for smallholder farmers, policymakers and other stakeholders in revealing the gab in the performance of the current vegetable production system to realize the national development policy.},

Challenges included an inefficient domestic seed distribution system, technical constraints in seed production and conditioning by seed companies, inadequate networks and communication among the seed industry's key participants, and partial regulation of the seed industry. Seed companies played a key role in seed conditioning processes. Companies imported all tomato seeds into Uganda and stated germination as their primary goal for quality. Challenges for seed companies included assistance from MAAIF to regulate and certify seed and access to improved technologies.

	abstract = {Climate shocks are predicted to increase in magnitude and frequency as the climate changes, notably impacting poor and vulnerable communities across the Tropics. The urgency to better understand and improve communities' resilience is reflected in international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the multiplication of adaptation research and action programs. In turn, the need for collecting and communicating evidence on the climate resilience of communities has increasingly drawn questions concerning how to assess resilience. While empirical case studies are often used to delve into the context-specific nature of resilience, synthesizing results is essential to produce generalizable findings at the scale at which policies are designed. Yet datasets, methods and modalities that enable cross-case analyses that draw from individual local studies are still rare in climate resilience literature. We use empirical case studies on the impacts of El Nino on smallholder households from five countries to test the application of quantitative data aggregation for policy recommendation. We standardized data into an aggregated dataset to explore how key demographic factors affected the impact of climate shocks, modeled as crop loss. We find that while cross-study results partially align with the findings from the individual projects and with theory, several challenges associated with quantitative aggregation remain when examining complex, contextual and multi-dimensional concepts such as resilience. We conclude that future exercises synthesizing cross-site empirical evidence in climate resilience could accelerate research to policy impact by using mixed methods, focusing on specific landscapes or regional scales, and facilitating research through the use of shared frameworks and learning exercises.},

Farmer participatory research (FPR) is an important approach to help ensure relevance and define locally adapted solutions for enhanced adoption of sustainable agriculture (SA) technologies. The mother and baby trial (MBT) design has proved effective as a FPR approach to address challenges on smallholder farms. The MBT systematically links long-term “mother” trials, where slow and erratic processes can be monitored, to “baby” trials led by farmers to capture a wide range of farm practices and environmental contexts. Communication and learning is facilitated through MBTs as well. This distributed FPR approach documents the performance of technologies in diverse contexts and provides multiple opportunities for joint planning, observation, and reflection. We describe two MBT case studies, one within a developing country context (Malawi) and the other representing a novel application of MBT within an intensive agriculture context (Michigan). To explore tradeoffs in SA performance, multiple domains (productivity, environmental, and economic) are presented via radar charts as a visualization tool. In both FPR experiences, farmer perspectives and a wide range of practices were revealed. In Malawi, a mesic site was associated with steep SA tradeoffs compared with a marginal site. In Michigan, diversity in tillage practices, field crop performance, and soil health were found to be conditioned by the environment. Overall, the MBT approach supported the development of SA technologies adapted to local conditions.},

Communication is integral to agricultural development, particularly so in the context of the FTLRP characterised by a dearth of information, education and training, ensued by the discriminatory command agriculture (Murisa and Chikweche, 2015). Farmers' preferences of communication media in receiving agricultural innovations should be prioritised to improve agricultural communication and subsequently, productivity, which is dire in Zimbabwe in the light of the continuing food insecurity. The findings indicated that farmers prefer media that are stimulating and engaging such as television and demonstrations; convenient such as mobile phones and detailed such as books probably because the majority of them do not have training in agriculture. Demographic variables of age-group and education were found to be associated with communication preferences of some media. The study has implications for agricultural communication media policy. Beyond prioritisation of farmers' preferences, a model of a multi-media approach to agricultural communication has been developed, that could widen communication reach if implemented.},

While scholars commonly assert that the foundation is part of a new breed of “philanthrocapitalists” who apply business principles to their philanthropic activities, little is known about what this really means or how the Gates Foundation works on the inside. This article seeks to deepen our understanding of this new development actor by examining its organizational culture. I do this through a case study of the Gates Foundation's Agricultural Development program. Using in-depth interviews, materials from the BMGF's website, and a variety of other primary data sources, I explore the foundation's quotidian practices, workplace norms, and interactions with grantees as it tries to improve the lives of smallholder farmers in Africa. I argue that the Gates Foundation's heavy emphasis on strategic planning has produced an approach to agricultural development that abstracts away from smallholder farmers' sociocultural worlds and relies on a generalizable set of development solutions. My analysis also reveals another significant consequence of the BMGF's organizational culture: By immersing bright, high-achieving professionals in the competitive, intense environment that characterizes the foundation, staff have learned to “manage up” (toward Bill) rather than manage down (toward their intended beneficiaries). This insulates and distances foundation staff from the field, making it difficult for them to listen to smallholder farmers, even though many express a genuine desire to do so. As a result, farmers continue to be treated as passive objects of development rather than as complex social actors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0204014},
	abstract = {Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) provide guidance to policy makers, the private sector and consumers to redesign food systems and to improve diets of vulnerable populations. As appropriate FBDGs are based on the actual dietary patterns and their costs, it is assumed that the recommended foods are available, affordable and acceptable for the population under study. Using quantitative dietary intake data of young children in rural Northern Ghana, we developed local FBDGs and studied whether these are supported by the diversity and quantity of the production of a household among 329 households. We found that 40\% of rural Northern Ghanaian infants and young children were stunted and their nutrient intakes were far below the recommendations: the probability of adequacy for most nutrient intakes was less than 50\%. At household level, the developed FBDGs were, on average, unable to sufficiently cover the household requirements for fat (60.4\% of recommended nutrient intake (RNI)), calcium (34.3\% RNI), iron (60.3\% RNI), vitamin A (39.1\% RNI), vitamin B12 (2.3\% RNI) and vitamin C (54.6\% RNI). This implies that even when these FBDGs are fully adopted the requirements for these nutrients will not be met. In addition, the nutrient needs and food needs (according to the developed FBDGs) of a household were only marginally covered by their own food production. The food production of over half the households supplied insufficient calcium (75.7\%), vitamin A (100\%), vitamin B12 (100\%) and vitamin C (77.5\%) to cover their needs. The food production of about 60\% of the households did not cover their required quantities of grains and legumes and none covered their required quantities of vegetables. Further analysis of the food gaps at district and national level showed that sufficient grains were available at both levels (267\% and 148\%, respectively) to meet requirements; availability of legumes was sufficient at district level (268\%) but not at national level (52\%); and vegetables were insufficient at both levels (2\% and 49\%, respectively). Diversifying household food production is often proposed as a means to increase the diversity of foods available and thereby increasing dietary diversity of rural populations. We found that the diversity of the production of a household was indeed positively related with their food and nutrient coverage. However, the diversity of the production of a household and their food and nutrient coverage were not related with children's dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy. Our results show that the production of a households does not support the adoption of FBDGs in rural Northern Ghana, especially for vegetables. This suggests that the promotion of FBDGs through nutrition education or behaviour change communications activities alone is insufficient to lead to improvements in diets. Additional strategies are needed to increase the food availability and accessibility of the households, especially that of fruits and vegetables, such as diversification of the crops grown, increased production of specific crops and market-based strategies.},

	abstract = {A transdisciplinary research approach requires that different scientists with their discipline-specific theories, concepts and methods find ways to work together with other societal players to address a real-life problem. In this study, the push-pull technology (PPT) was used as a boundary object to enable interactions among stakeholders across science-practice boundaries engaged in the control of stemborer pest in maize crops in Bako Tibe, Jimma Arjo and YayuWoredas in Ethiopia between August 2014 and April 2015. The PPT is a biological mechanism developed by researchers for the control of stemborer pests and Striga weed in maize crop. It involves inter-cropping maize with a stemborer moth-repellent silverleaf or greenleaf Desmodium (push), and planting an attractive trap crop, Napier or Brachiaria grass (pull), around it. The on-farm implementation of PPT was used to provide an opportunity for collaboration, interaction and learning among stakeholders including researchers from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research and practitioners from the Ministry of Agriculture and smallholder farmers/traders. The research was implemented following the transdisciplinary action research and the data collected using mixed methods approach, including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, workshops, on-farm practical demonstrations and participant observations. The findings show that collaborative leadership provides a chance for the stakeholders to participate in the technology learning and decision making, by enabling them to jointly contribute skills towards development, refinement and adaptation of the PPT. In situations where there are conflicts, they are embraced and converted to opportunities for in-depth learning, finding solutions and adaptation of the innovation processes rather than being sources of contradictions or misunderstandings. The leadership roles of the farmers enabled them to reflect on their own practices and draw on scientific explanations from researchers. It also enabled them to take the lead in new technology implementation and information sharing with fellow farmers and other stakeholders in a free and easy manner. Although the perennial nature of the companion crops in the PPT provides opportunities for continuous stakeholder interaction and learning, it requires a personally committed leadership and formal institutional engagements for the sustainability of the activities, which span several cropping seasons. Market forces and the involvement of the private sector also play a role as shown from the involvement of individual farmers and traders in Desmodium and Brachiaria seed production, collection and distribution during the PPT implementation.},

This work presents innovative educational tool developed to engaging community voices to understand food insecurity and to create local solutions. The 16 workshops inspired on the theory of the Pedagogy of the Oppressed, involved a total of 270 participants across the four case studies in remote Tanzanian villages. The results show that community voices and local problem perceptions significantly differed between the case study regions, which had a strong impact on coping strategies and nutritional status. In Morogoro, e.g., food insecurity was mainly related to conflicts. Smallholders with anemia prefer to avoid meat and milk as these products come from livestock keepers who have destroyed their crop farm production. More than 70 local diverse solutions were identified. The acceptance of the educational tools used was highly appreciated at local level compared to more conventional procedures (e.g. questionnaires). The pedagogical methods applied in this work served to raise the communities' voices, to promote consciences about communities' problems, and reframing their images of the future. The understanding of community perceptions might help with the implementation of sustainable nutrition-sensitive innovations.},

	abstract = {Land-use changes have dramatically transformed tropical landscapes. We describe an ecological- economic land-use change model as an integrated, exploratory tool used to analyze how tropical land-use change affects ecological and socio-economic functions. The model analysis seeks to determine what kind of landscape mosaic can improve the ensemble of ecosystem functioning, biodiversity, and economic benefit based on the synergies and trade-offs that we have to account for. More specifically, (1) how do specific ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage, and economic functions, such as household consumption, relate to each other? (2) How do external factors, such as the output prices of crops, affect these relationships? (3) How do these relationships change when production inefficiency differs between smallholder farmers and learning is incorporated? We initialize the ecological-economic model with artificially generated land-use maps parameterized to our study region. The economic sub-model simulates smallholder land-use management decisions based on a profit maximization assumption. Each household determines factor inputs for all household fields and decides on land-use change based on available wealth. The ecological sub-model includes a simple account of carbon sequestration in above-ground and below-ground vegetation. We demonstrate model capabilities with results on household consumption and carbon sequestration from different output price and farming efficiency scenarios. The overall results reveal complex interactions between the economic and ecological spheres. For instance, model scenarios with heterogeneous crop-specific household productivity reveal a comparatively high inertia of land-use change. Our model analysis even shows such an increased temporal stability in landscape composition and carbon stocks of the agricultural area under dynamic price trends. These findings underline the utility of ecological- economic models, such as ours, to act as exploratory tools which can advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the trade-offs and synergies of ecological and economic functions in tropical landscapes.},

It demonstrates the importance of aspirations to informing agricultural policies and understanding the behaviour of farmers and their vision regarding their farms. The Heckman two-step regression model was used to determine factors affecting aspirations/willingness of farmers to expand in the first stage and their ability to achieve or realise those aspirations in the second stage. The paper identifies five key factors that influence farmer aspirations (willingness to expand), i.e., positive psychological capital, access to markets, access to credit, land tenure security, and membership in other social groups. Gender, asset ownership, access to markets and local resource use conflicts were significant in determining farmers' ability to achieve those aspirations. The study reveals the importance of developing positive psychological capital among smallholders and affirms the need for affordable production credit. To better make use of irrigation schemes, there is a need to build the capacity of smallholders to achieve their aspirations through empowering women and improving access to physical assets and markets. Land tenure security concerns need addressing while supporting institutions that promote social interaction and learning remain vital for the growth of the smallholder irrigation sector.},

However, there is still much to learn about the various connections and interactions associated with reactions to what are often referred to as land grabs, and the ways they are associated or not associated with broader social movements and networks opposed to land grabbing. There is also the need to develop language for discussing these circumstances, something I aim to contribute to in this article. Here, I present four different cases of types of resistance, or what I refer to as contingent contestations, to land concessions in southern Laos and northeastern Cambodia (two from each country), focusing on the perspectives and associated strategies of smallholder farmers, but without ignoring broader issues. I consider the roles of locals in these contestations, through emphasizing the importance of histories, identities/ethnicities, politics, and geography in determining the types of responses to these land deals that emerge, and the strategies that are adopted for contesting these developments.},

This paper reviews 31 past studies focusing on the factors influencing the adoption of SAPs. Using a vote count methodology, SAPs adoption is revealed as a complex set of behaviors which depend on a range of socio-economic, agroecological, institutional, informational, psychological factors and perceived attributes. Identified within these six dimensions, male farmers, higher educational attainment levels, bigger farm size, steeper farms, and the presence of land right security emerge as common factors which often lead to adopt SAPs. These factors imply the general importance of economic motivations in facilitating sustainable farm management. In particular, gender, farm topography, and land tenure have a special role in the context of developing countries. These common factors, and other converged factors, lend support to drawing general policymaking guidelines by identifying the characteristics of potential adopters, promotion strategies, and effective communication channels. For effective local management, future research should consider a range of factors from multiple categories and identify the relative importance of statistically significant ones.},

	abstract = {The values of watershed services from watersheds has for many years been neglected, underestimated and not factored in land use decisions for sustainable management. Sustainable management of watersheds and environmental friendly economic activities are vital for sustained water flow, steady supply of ecosystem services for societal needs and enhancement of aquatic vegetation and animal species. The problem of the failure to capture actual values of ecosystem services from watersheds and incorporate them in the national income accounting is profound in developing countries which are characterized with constrained budget for financing conservation programs. To resolve this problem attention has moved to market based instruments such as payment for watershed services (PWS). However, the approach to elicit the necessary information for PWS to kick off is still lacking. Furthermore, Ecohydrology, defined as an integrative sustainability science using the interactions between hydrology, biota and natural processes as management tools to reinforce ecosystem services on a broad range of landscapes (Zalewski, 2015) is a basis for the development and application of market-based approaches in watershed conservation. This study investigated small holder farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for watershed services in Pangani River Basin. A contingent valuation method was employed to elicit the willingness to pay for watershed conservation. A probit model was used to determine respondents' response to WTP and factors conditioning the maximum amount they are WTP. Findings indicates that majority of respondents are willing to pay for watershed services. Similarly, result reveals that marital status, household size and distance from the water source positively influence smallholder farmers' WTP and the maximum amount to be paid. Equally important occupation, household size, income from irrigation, and amount paid for irrigation were found to negatively influencing smallholder farmers' WTP. The result also revealed that education level, total land size and yield from irrigated farm plot positively influence smallholder farmers' WTP. These results therefore, indicate that establishment of PWS is feasible. (C) 2016 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier Sp. z o. o.

However, adoption of the set of complementary technologies that are required in ISFM is quite variable and studies tend to focus on single technologies. In this study we used cluster analysis to group technologies and ordered probit to determine the probability of multiple technology adoption. The result show that usage of ISFM in the Chinyanja Triangle (Southern Africa) is grouped into 3 technological sets based on complementarities. The set of nutrient dense technologies of inorganic fertiliser, compost and animal manure (ISFMset3) indicates that they are used by farmers who face similar opportunities of having land that require minimal input, sell produce at farm gate as opposed to market, have more transport and communication facilities, and recover from livestock loss. Loss of crops, however, deter adoption of this set. The technological set comprising of fallow, rotation and grain legumes (ISFMset2) which enhances biomass accumulation and nitrogen fixation with complementary effects in cereal dominated farming system, is more likely adopted by households with land that require more inputs, are more educated, own more bicycles and have higher financial capital. Other four technologies (ISFMset1 including mulch, lime, compost and agroforestry) are used by a few individuals to address specific constraints in nutrient and water retention, and acidity. The result also indicated variations in usage of ISFMset3 between sites. These results are instrumental in identifying factors that influence adoption of a set of ISFM technologies in the Chinyanja Triangle and could be of use in targeting research and development initiatives.

This helps smallholder producer(s) in occupational diversification and gainful income. These economically important institutions also serve social purposes.

In semiarid regions, the nature of dependence on these institutions among communities for their livelihood becomes particularly more important. The present study appreciates behaviour of farmers to supply milk to dairy society in Panchmahal district, a semiarid region of Gujarat state, India. The relationship pattern of socioeconomic variables viz., age, education, land size and total milk production were assessed towards linkage of farmers with this particular village institution. The nature of such linkage by society with local institutions often determines technological refinement, intervention and adoption. The study did not find any significant relationship for variables like age, education and total milk production in respect to farmers approaching milk cooperative societies. However, land holding size among respondents appeared to be a significant factor towards supply of milk to societies/society. This clearly demonstrates importance of identifying and understanding variables that can influence livestock interventions through dairy societies.

By facilitating interaction, negotiation and collective action between farmers, researchers and other stakeholders, IPs can contribute to more integrated, systemic innovation that is essential for achieving agricultural development impacts. However, successful implementation of IPs requires institutional change within AR4D establishments. The objective of this paper is to reflect on the implementation and institutionalisation of IPs in present AR4D programmes. We use experiences from sub-Saharan Africa to demonstrate how the adoption and adaptation of IPs creates both opportunities and challenges that influence platform performance and impact. Niche-regime theory is used to understand challenges, and anticipate on how to deal with them. A key concern is whether IPs in AR4D challenge or reinforce existing technology-oriented agricultural innovation paradigms. For example, stakeholder representation, facilitation and institutional embedding determine to a large extent whether the IP can strengthen systemic capacity to innovate that can lead to real paradigm change, or are merely old wine in new bottles' and a continuation of business as usual'. Institutional embedding of IPs and - more broadly - the transition from technology-oriented to system-oriented AR4D approaches requires structural changes in organisational mandates, incentives, procedures and funding, as well as investments in exchange of experiences, learning and capacity development.},

	abstract = {The preference of an innovation systems approach to development is based on its inclusiveness and the interactions of actors to co-influence each other, to learn and innovate and to bring about tangible benefits. As more actors with diverse interests engage, the innovation system becomes more complex and actors with higher influence power are likely to benefit more. Smallholder farmers in developing countries are the core actors of an agricultural innovation system, but their ability to influence other actors to maximize their benefits is questionable. This article applies a historical analysis of the progressive development and complexity of Malawi's diary innovation system through phased emphasis on technological, organizational and institutional development to illustrate the centrality of smallholder dairy farmers in the innovation system. A social network analysis is applied to assess the influence of smallholder farmers on other actors. The existence and growth of the diary innovation system in Malawi is founded on the resilience of smallholder dairy farmers to produce milk. Whereas the smallholder farmers are the most connected in terms of interaction, they have the least influence on other actors in the innovation system. To take advantage of their central position to maximize benefits, smallholder farmers can only rely on their collective power to influence others. Organizing farmers in groups and associations is a step in the right direction but deliberate interventions by innovation brokers as intermediaries need to focus on empowering these groups.},

	abstract = {Over recent decades, there has been increasing levels of research dedicated to assess drivers of farm-level uptake of adaptation strategies to climate change. The main purpose of this research being to determine how policy intervention can most effectively increase adoption. This paper aims to synthesise this past research in order to scale up uptake of farm-level adaptation strategies through a composite index of potential adoption in Africa. In doing so, we review the estimated coefficients of econometric regressions in 42 case studies published in peer-review journals to identify the factors that regularly explain adoption. We find that these common factors can be grouped into seven components, that is human capital, financial resources, infrastructure and technology, social interaction and governance, food security, dependence on agriculture and attitudes towards the environment. Using national-level indicators of these seven categories, we develop a composite index to inform potential adoption and test the robustness of the index in an in-depth sensitivity analysis. The results show that the highest likelihood of adoption of farm-level adaptation strategies is in Northern African countries namely Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco and in Southern African countries such as South Africa and Botswana. Conversely, they indicate that the lowest likelihood of adoption is situated in nations of the Sahel and Horn of Africa and in nations that have recently experienced conflict. We conclude that adoption is associated predominantly with governance, civil rights, financial resources and education. However, it is not necessarily driven by the magnitude of climate change impacts on agricultural production.},

	abstract = {There is limited field-based research and recommendations on the effect of cattle feeding management practices on smallholder dairy farms (SDF) for the growing dairy industry in Kenya. This controlled trial aimed to determine the effect of feeding locally produced dairy meal (DM) on early lactation daily milk production (DMP) on Kenyan SDF, controlling for other factors associated with DMP. Privately owned, recently calved cows (n=111) were randomly assigned to one of three groups of feeding recommendations for DM (meeting predicted DM requirements by: (1) 100\%; (2) 50\%; or (3) feeding by the farmer's discretion). DM was provided for free to groups 1 and 2 to ensure they had sufficient DM to feed to the recommendations. Data collection on cow and farm characteristics occurred biweekly for a 60-day period post-calving starting in June 2013. A repeated measures multivariable linear regression model was used on the DMP outcome variable. With variability in DM consumption within feeding groups due to variability in DMP, actual DM fed was assessed as an independent variable rather than assigned feeding groups. DMP was positively associated with each kg/day of DM fed (0.53 kg/day), cow weight (0.13 kg/day), feeding DM in the month prior to calving (1.42 kg/day), and feeding high protein forage (0.41 kg/day), and was negatively associated with having mastitis (-0.30 kg/day). In interaction terms, taller cows had higher DMP than shorter cows, whereas heifers (first parity cows) had similar DMP regardless of height. Also, thin cows (2+ parity with body condition score {\textless} 2.5 out of 5) produced less milk (1.0 kg/day less) than cows with a better body condition score at calving,whereas thin heifers produced more milk (2.0 kg/day more) than heifers in better body condition-this association is possibly due to a small unrepresentative sample size of heifers. In conclusion, feeding DM in the month prior to calving, improving body condition in cows prior to calving, and enhancing dietary DM and high protein forage were positively associated with DMP in early lactation on Kenyan SDF. In addition there was an association between, taller cows and increased DMP, evidence supporting the importance of educating farmers on good genetic selection and heifer management. These findings will help with future management recommendations for higher DMP on SDF. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Many development initiatives focus on the enhancement of smallholder production and productivity because the majority of poor people in developing countries live in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood. The consequences of these development initiatives need to be assessed before implementation to reduce the risk of possible negative impacts. This can be done by applying ex ante sustainability impact assessment. Here, we compare methods of assessment of sustainability impact for farming interventions. We review methodological approaches and verify whether the requirements of sustainability impact assessment theory are fulfilled. Our major points are the following: (1) main methodological approaches do not fulfill the requirements defined in the theoretical sustainability impact assessment discourse. (2) The active involvement of different stakeholder groups throughout the assessment process and the possibility of learning and exchange are fundamental to sustainability impact assessment. (3) The institutional dimension of sustainability is not yet sufficiently integrated. We therefore suggest institutional criteria and indicators to be also considered in the sustainability impact assessment framework. We argue that sustainability impact assessment, respecting the interactive involvement of all stakeholder groups throughout the whole process, is a compulsory element in project planning for a sustainable agricultural development in developing countries.},

Crop intensification through subsidies could have indirect impacts through gains/losses in income and purchasing power, as well as direct influences on local availability. An integrated household survey conducted multiple times in Malawi provided evidence-based insights into the complex interactions between agriculture and nutrition. The nationally representative dataset indicated that agricultural input subsidies did not preclude crop or dietary diversity. Two pathways of subsidy impact appeared to be operating: an association with diversified cropping for a direct influence on available food quality; and an association with adoption of modern maize varieties for an indirect influence through commercialization and income that supports diverse food purchases. Although crop diversity was positively associated with dietary diversity, we found that education, income, market access, and availability of improved storage technologies had higher influence on dietary diversity. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the need for complementary investments in both education and employment creation, particularly for female heads of households.},

A two-way communication participatory process provided insights into the complex vulnerability context of farmers, their primary concerns with processing and markets of cassava in order to improve livelihoods, the lack of networks with two way communication flows, and the lack of information on GM technologies. The translational research engaged farmers and scientists in an iterative process where scientists are learning what farmers need, and farmers are learning about the potential benefits and risks from GM technologies, while at the same time expressing their concerns.},

The analysis focuses on how structural conditions (infrastructure, institutions, interaction and collaboration and capabilities and resources) enable or constrain interactions between niche-level Jatropha experiments and incumbent energy, agriculture and rural development regimes in Mozambique. Investors in agro-industrial Jatropha projects focused on establishing projects in areas with relatively good infrastructure, rather than in remote rural areas. Furthermore, they predominantly focused on Jatropha production instead of investing in the entire Jatropha value chain, which turned out to be a challenge in itself, as growing a productive Jatropha crop was much more complex than initially anticipated. The development of institutions that could nurture and protect Jatropha projects from the prevailing regimes lagged behind Jatropha project establishment, leading to an insecure investment climate. Strong inter-ministerial collaboration and organized civil society interaction and representation contrasted with non-organized private sector and rather isolated smallholder Jatropha projects. The global financial crisis and limited adaptive capacity reduced the time and space for experimentation and learning to overcome disappointing crop performance. Together, this hampered Jatropha's potential to challenge the energy, agricultural and rural development regimes. Nevertheless, the Jatropha experience did initiate the development of policy and regulation and stimulated interaction and collaboration between specific groups of stakeholders, which could provide the basis to capture future biofuel momentum in Mozambique.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farming systems often consist of a mosaic of interlinked forested and cleared-field patches that together provide a diversity of services to local and non-local stakeholders. Designing and adopting more sustainable farming systems for such mosaic landscapes involves communal decision-making and active participation of local smallholders. Currently, a wide variety of participatory approaches to involve individual farmers in such design processes is available. However, methodologies that address communal decision-making processes as seen in complex smallholder agricultural landscapes are still rare. Here, we present a gaming methodology developed to (i) actively involve farmers in the process of agroecosystem design, and (ii) to identify factors and patterns of communal decision-making through an in-depth analysis of game strategies deployed by participants. At the basis of this methodology is the RESORTES board game; a stylized yet complex land-use game rich in ecological and social outcomes. Results of four pilot sessions in a usufruct community in the buffer zone of a Man and Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, showed that the game sessions created an open and active discussion among participants. Discussions concerned land-use issues in the game and in real-life. It allowed participants that were new to active involvement in communal decision-making to openly discuss and share their ideas. The highly structured monitoring and analysis scheme for ex-ante/ex-post analysis was easy in use and identified communication, leadership and relatedness among participants as influential factors that smoothened the collective decision-making process. The RESORTES board game and related games can shed light on farmer's actual views on and responses to multifunctional agricultural landscape planning and the land sharing vs. land sparing dilemmas currently in debate in academic and policy-making settings. The findings of this paper can be useful to inform strategies for community involvement in agroecosystem design in a broader set of complex socio-environmental context, using serious game to guide agricultural landscape planning processes.

	abstract = {This study was done to find out about animal health service providers and factors that determined demand for community based veterinary service delivery in smallholder sector of Zimbabwe. Focus group discussions and a questionnaire was used to collect data on veterinary services providers and socio-economic factors related to animal health from a sample (N = 333) smallholder livestock farmers from Gutu district of Masvingo province in Zimbabwe. Analytical techniques used were descriptive statistics, K-mean cluster analysis and Tobit regression model. Results showed that the majority of farmers (45\%) obtained services from both Community Based Animal Health Workers (CBAHWs) and Department of Veterinary Service (DVS), 25\% DVS only, 20\% used CBAHWs while 10\% did not seek any services. Further analysis showed that distance to CBAHW, distance to AHMC and employment status were significantly related to demand for CBAHWs with coefficients of -1.5, 0.7 and -10.3, respectively. The study thus concluded that CBAHW is an alternative animal health service delivery approach already practiced in smallholder farming sectors of Zimbabwe. Socio-economic factors significantly influenced the demand for CBAHW services. Given limited resources by state sponsored veterinary services, it is recommended that the CBAHWs approach should be encouraged as supplementary service provider especially in areas further DVS. These community organizations can be empowered by the state to deliver more improved services based on hygiene and modern science at a relatively low cost to farmers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The agricultural innovation systems approach emphasizes the collective nature of innovation and stresses that innovation is a co-evolutionary process, resulting from alignment of technical, social, institutional and organizational dimensions. These insights are increasingly informing interventions that focus on setting up multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as innovation platforms and networks, as mechanisms for enhancing agricultural innovation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. There has been much emphasis on how such platforms are organized, but only limited analysis unravelling how they shape co-evolution of innovation processes. This paper addresses this gap and conceptualizes platforms as intermediaries that connect the different actors in innovation systems in order to foster effective co-evolution. We present a case study of a smallholder dairy development programme in Kenya, led by a consortium of five organizations that provide a platform for building multi-actor partnerships to enhance smallholder dairy productivity and improve livelihoods. The findings indicate that co-evolution of innovation is a highly dynamic process with various interactional tensions and unexpected effects, and that the distributed nature of intermediation is important in resolving some of these tensions emerging at different actor interfaces. However, platforms are not always able to adapt adequately to emerging issues. This points to the need to look at platforms dynamically and pay more attention to mechanisms that strengthen feedback, learning and adaptive management in innovation processes.

	abstract = {Formal and informal rules create an institutional framework that governs the operations of a democratic society. They require various forms of organisational structures to implement them. These are the oft-forgotten links in sustainable forest management and good forest governance. This paper examines some of the major causal influences that have shaped and are shaping institutional frameworks and supporting organisations in Australia and that are likely to influence forestry employment and education. These include sometimes conflicting, sometimes complementary, influences between state and corporate forestry, industrial and smallholder forestry, in-house expertise and contracting out, regulation and certification, and decentralisation and centralisation. Because institutional change is often largely a political response to satisfy different constituents, change is likely to continue, with increasing diversity in the resulting organisations and complexity in their interactions. Competitive market processes will increasingly replace bureaucratic allocation and management wherever commercial products and services are supplied or wherever potentially commercial services can be hived off from state departments. Almost every conceivable combination now exists in the organisational structures responsible for state forestry policy, regulation, commercial timber management, reserve management, research and fire management across the different states of Australia. The greatest challenge for forestry education in Australia is whether the gulf in the mutual perceptions of the major timber management and reserve management organisations can be bridged to take advantage of the mutual concerns while acknowledging and respecting the differences. Forestry education needs revision to deal with the demands for core subjects and specialisation, the roles of kindred education courses, manageable costs, and the differing needs of polity in relation to forestry.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2334-12-58},
	abstract = {Background: The recent avian influenza epidemic in Asia and the H1N1 pandemic demonstrated that influenza A viruses pose a threat to global public health. The animal origins of the viruses confirmed the potential for interspecies transmission. Swine are hypothesized to be prime “mixing vessels” due to the dual receptivity of their trachea to human and avian strains. Additionally, avian and human influenza viruses have previously been isolated in swine. Therefore, understanding interspecies contact on smallholder swine farms and its potential role in the transmission of pathogens such as influenza virus is very important. Methods: This qualitative study aimed to determine swine-associated interspecies contacts in two coastal areas of Peru. Direct observations were conducted at both small-scale confined and low-investment swine farms (n = 36) and in open areas where swine freely range during the day (n = 4). Interviews were also conducted with key stakeholders in swine farming. Results: In both locations, the intermingling of swine and domestic birds was common. An unexpected contact with avian species was that swine were fed poultry mortality in 6/20 of the farms in Chancay. Human-swine contacts were common, with a higher frequency on the confined farms. Mixed farming of swine with chickens or ducks was observed in 36\% of all farms. Human-avian interactions were less frequent overall. Use of adequate biosecurity and hygiene practices by farmers was suboptimal at both locations. Conclusions: Close human-animal interaction, frequent interspecies contacts and suboptimal biosecurity and hygiene practices pose significant risks of interspecies influenza virus transmission. Farmers in small-scale swine production systems constitute a high-risk population and need to be recognized as key in preventing interspecies pathogen transfer. A two-pronged prevention approach, which offers educational activities for swine farmers about sound hygiene and biosecurity practices and guidelines and education for poultry farmers about alternative approaches for processing poultry mortality, is recommended. Virological and serological surveillance for influenza viruses will also be critical for these human and animal populations.},

Promoted by the Mozambican government, Nhambita community established jatropha trials in 2005. Initial results were promising, but crop failure and the absence of organized markets led to scepticism amongst farmers. We start from the idea that the promotion of community-based biofuel production and use requires taking interactions between social-cultural, biophysical, economic, political and legal subsystems across different scales and levels of analysis through time into account. Our analysis demonstrates that heterogeneous farming strategies and their synergies at community level should be carefully assessed. Furthermore, national and international political and legal developments, such as the development of biofuel sustainability criteria, influence the local space in which community-based biofuel developments take place. We conclude that ex-ante integrated assessment and creating an enabling environment can enhance space for sustainable community-based biofuel production and use. It may provide insights into the opportunities and constraints for different types of smallholders, and promote the development of adequate policy mechanisms to prevent biofuels from becoming a threat rather than an opportunity for smallholders.

Critical to identifying the impact of the programme is the careful construction of a counterfactual and meticulous data collection. To assess the impact of the programme on production, a weighted estimation, where weights are constructed through propensity score matching, is employed to estimate a production function within a damage abatement framework. The function incorporates a series of interaction terms to assess the impact of the programme on the production technology. The findings provide evidence that the programme enhances yields both through a general shift in technology as well as increased input use. The results suggest that the use of effective farming techniques that are learned through the programme induce this technological shift.},

Our study objective was to use an integrated livestock and crop model to assess the outcomes from selected suites of management decisions observed in smallholder sheep-cropping systems of Yucatan, Mexico. The scenarios contrasted specialized systems versus mixed farming, and evaluated the outcomes of increased crop-livestock integration. Mixed enterprise scenarios involving sheep provided more income than specialized enterprises, and capitalized on a lower price of on-farm maize grain, efficient utilization of surplus labor, and availability of common land. Labor and management income was greatest for the unintegrated and partially integrated crop and livestock scenarios. It was more profitable for producers to sell excess grain and maize stover, and use common land to feed the livestock, suggesting that increased integration does not always result in improved outcomes. The results are consistent with a system not yet pushed to the point where integration is inevitable. For all sets of scenarios, the model structure was able to accommodate subtle management differences to produce appropriate biophysical, labor, and economic outcomes. We conclude there is potential to use similar model development methods to describe other crop-livestock systems, thus providing tools for learning, scenario analysis, and impact assessment.

	doi = {10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.11.025},
	abstract = {Requirements for research, practices and policies affecting soil management in relation to global food security are reviewed. Managing soil organic carbon (C) is central because soil organic matter influences numerous soil properties relevant to ecosystem functioning and crop growth. Even small changes in total C content can have disproportionately large impacts on key soil physical properties. Practices to encourage maintenance of soil C are important for ensuring sustainability of all soil functions. Soil is a major store of C within the biosphere - increases or decreases in this large stock can either mitigate or worsen climate change. Deforestation, conversion of grasslands to arable cropping and drainage of wetlands all cause emission of C; policies and international action to minimise these changes are urgently required. Sequestration of C in soil can contribute to climate change mitigation but the real impact of different options is often misunderstood. Some changes in management that are beneficial for soil C. increase emissions of nitrous oxide (a powerful greenhouse gas) thus cancelling the benefit. Research on soil physical processes and their interactions with roots can lead to improved and novel practices to improve crop access to water and nutrients. Increased understanding of root function has implications for selection and breeding of crops to maximise capture of water and nutrients. Roots are also a means of delivering natural plant-produced chemicals into soil with potentially beneficial impacts. These include biocontrol of soil-borne pests and diseases and inhibition of the nitrification process in soil (conversion of ammonium to nitrate) with possible benefits for improved nitrogen use efficiency and decreased nitrous oxide emission. The application of molecular methods to studies of soil organisms, and their interactions with roots, is providing new understanding of soil ecology and the basis for novel practical applications. Policy makers and those concerned with development of management approaches need to keep a watching brief on emerging possibilities from this fast-moving area of science. Nutrient management is a key challenge for global food production: there is an urgent need to increase nutrient availability to crops grown by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Many changes in practices including inter-cropping, inclusion of nitrogen-fixing crops, agroforestry and improved recycling have been clearly demonstrated to be beneficial: facilitating policies and practical strategies are needed to make these widely available, taking account of local economic and social conditions. In the longer term fertilizers will be essential for food security: policies and actions are needed to make these available and affordable to small farmers. In developed regions, and those developing rapidly such as China, strategies and policies to manage more precisely the necessarily large flows of nutrients in ways that minimise environmental damage are essential. A specific issue is to minimise emissions of nitrous oxide whilst ensuring sufficient nitrogen is available for adequate food production. Application of known strategies (through either regulation or education), technological developments, and continued research to improve understanding of basic processes will all play a part. Decreasing soil erosion is essential, both to maintain the soil resource and to minimise downstream damage such as sedimentation of rivers with adverse impacts on fisheries. Practical strategies are well known but often have financial implictions for farmers. Examples of systems for paying one group of land users for ecosystem services affecting others exist in several parts of the world and serve as a model.

Each strategy followed unique family trajectories and established distinct human-environment interactions.

Data for the study were collected in June and August 2003 using household-level questionnaires and stratified random sampling, where strata were membership status and gender. Probit analysis of 250 farmers shows that off-farm sources of income, distance of the farmer's household from Kasungu District centre, age of the farmer, tobacco farming, education, household level land holding and gender determined the decision to join NASFAM. These results suggest that farmers should be informed of the potential benefits of participating in rural development efforts, and that rural communication and information infrastructure should be improved so as to reduce the costs of information access and transactions in general, if participation in organisations such as NASFAM is to be enhanced.},

Local participation is essential for the implementation of sustainable agriculture strategy. We conducted a case study in Hailun County, an important grain production base in China, to find ways to motivate farmers to participate in sustainable agriculture. We obtained data from semi-structured interviews of 98 households using participatory rural appraisal methods. Logistic regression models were used to explore factors that underlie farmers' attitudes towards agricultural production and their environmental awareness. Results indicated that low agricultural economic efficiency could result in less enthusiasm for agriculture among local farmers. This is a potential risk for China's food security and sustainable agricultural development. The backward development of the rural economy limited improvement of farmers' environmental awareness. Moreover, poor rural labour quality implied a lack of local participation in sustainable agriculture. Suggestions for sustainable agricultural development include establishment of a reasonable market and agricultural subsidy mechanisms, basic and vocational education for young adults, effective agricultural instruction and environmental education agencies and two-way communication mechanisms.},

	abstract = {At global scale nutrient flows are unbalanced, resulting in huge surpluses in Western Europe versus negative balances in Africa. Existing policy and socio-economic environments in different parts of the world are the major cause of this situation. At lower spatial scales, a much more complex and diverse picture emerges. In Sub-Saharan Africa, different levels and causes of soil fertility decline are found among agro-ecological zones, soil types, farm systems, wealth groups, urban-rural households, cash and food crops, home fields and bush fields. Technology development has been the traditional response to address nutrient imbalances in general, and soil fertility decline in Africa in particular. Farm households have continued to develop and adapt existing technology to changing situations. National and international research institutions have followed a variety of changing approaches of which the recently developed participatory approaches have yielded some impressive results in isolated cases. These efforts have, however, not led to the necessary massive reversion of the trend in soil fertility decline. The Dutch policies on nutrient use and the Indonesian policy to adopt Integrated Pest Management are two examples, associated with such major trend reversions. This suggests that promoting and supporting participatory technologies have limited impact when no attention is paid to participatory policy development and implementation. In order to mobilise farm households in a trend reversion, a number of conditions should be met such as stable prices for agricultural outputs, better input/output prices ratios, influence of land users on the research agenda and private-public initiatives focused on smallholders. This observation calls for the establishment of interactive landusers-science-policy triangles at various scales (local, national and international) in which joint learning and mediating may lead to more informed decision making, more focused design of an agricultural sector policy, implementation of policies by effective institutions, and appropriate technology development and implementation. Interventions need to be reoriented: less technology development, more policy influence and institution building. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Seasonal climate forecasts provide probabilistic information on future climate on time-scales of two to three months. Where this information is not presently used it is difficult to evaluate the impact it might have. In order to justify disseminating the information to marginal groups it is important that the potential impact of the forecast is explored so that the negative and positive effects are at least partially appreciated before use of the information is widely promoted. We use an agent-based social simulation model, based on empirical evidence from field work in Lesotho, to assess the impact of using seasonal forecasts among smallholder farmers. The impact of using the forecast depends on the agents' initial household characteristics, what options they choose in responding to the forecast and the trust they place in the forecast (which in turn depends on their ability to learn and to follow their neighbours). Interaction of climate, crop productivity and social factors determines how much household-agents benefit or lose, evaluated in terms of crop yields and likelihood of exhausting food storage. Adoption of the forecast has the potential to decrease starvation among marginal household-agents but poor forecasts may do more harm than good. This work suggests that if forecasts are not correct more than 60-70\% of the time, then they are unlikely to benefit poor farmers. Poor forecasts, or forecasts that fail badly, when they do fail, lead to longer adoption timescales for forecast use. Further investigation into the impact of the forecast at the village level is encouraged before dissemination is actively pursued without appreciating potential impacts. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Balancing the numerous benefits that may accrue from pesticide use on cotton, farmers face health hazards. Pesticide-induced acute symptoms significantly increased the cost-of-illness in a survey of 280 smallholder cotton growers in two districts of Zimbabwe. Cotton growers lost a mean of Z\$180 in Sanyati and Z\$316 per year in Chipinge on pesticide-related direct and indirect acute health effects. These values are equivalent to 45\% and 83\% of annual household pesticide expenditures in the two districts. The time spent recuperating from illnesses attributed to pesticides averaged 2 days in Sanyati and 4 days in Chipinge during the 1998/1999 growing season. These pesticide health cost estimates represent lower bounds only; they omit chronic pesticide health effects as well as suffering and other non-monetary costs. Acute pesticide symptoms were determined in large part by pesticide use practices, notably the lack of protective clothing. Yet many smallholder farmers misunderstood pesticide health hazards, and so did little to protect themselves. Despite the use of simple color codes, 22\% of smallholder cotton growers in Sanyati and 58\% in Chipinge did not know how the four colored triangles communicated increasing degrees of pesticide toxicity. Better farmer education in exposure averting strategies is needed. Likewise, fuller accounting for hidden health costs in future would allow farmers to make more informed decisions about agricultural pest management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	title = {The impacts of agroforestry interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being in low- and middle-income countries: {A} systematic review},
	volume = {17},
	doi = {10.1002/cl2.1167},
	abstract = {Background Agroforestry, the intentional integration of trees or other woody perennials with crops or livestock in production systems, is being widely promoted as a conservation and development tool to help meet the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Donors, governments, and nongovernmental organizations have invested significant time and resources into developing and promoting agroforestry policies and programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) worldwide. While a large body of literature on the impacts of agroforestry practices in LMICs is available, the social-ecological impacts of agroforestry interventions is less well-studied. This knowledge gap on the effectiveness of agroforestry interventions constrains possibilities for evidence-based policy and investment decisions to advance sustainable development objectives. Objectives The primary objective of this Campbell systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions in LMICs on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. The secondary objectives were to identify key pathways through which agroforestry interventions lead to various outcomes and how the interventions affect different sub-groups of the population. Search Methods This review is based on a previously created evidence and gap map (EGM) of studies evaluating the impacts of agroforestry practices and interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. We included published and unpublished literature in the English language covering the period between 2000 and October 20, 2017. We searched six academic databases and 19 organization websites to identify potentially relevant studies. The search was conducted for our EGM in mid-2017, and we did not conduct an additional search for this systematic review. Selection Criteria We included randomized control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies assessing the effect of an agroforestry intervention on at least one outcome measure of agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, or human well-being for farmers and their farmland in LMICs. Agroforestry interventions include any program or policy designed to promote and support the adoption or maintenance of agroforestry practices, which include trees on farms, silvopasture, shade-grown crops, and homegardens with trees, among others. Moreover, the studies needed to include a nonagroforestry comparator, such as conventional agriculture or forestry systems or a before-after comparison. Data Collection and Analysis We used a standardized data extraction spreadsheet to extract details about each included study. We also used a standardized form to assess risk of bias for each of the included studies in this SR. Meta-analysis techniques were used to combine and synthesize effect size estimates for the outcomes measures that had sufficient data. We used a random effects models for the meta-analyses and use Hedge's g (difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation) to report effect size estimates. The outcomes without enough evidence for meta-analysis were discussed narratively. Main Results We identified 11 studies across nine countries, all of which used quasi-experimental methods. Overall, the quality of the evidence base was assessed as being low. Studies were rated as having high or critical risk of bias if they failed to convincingly address more than one of the main potential sources of bias, namely selection bias, group equivalence, and spillover effects. Given the low number of studies and the high risk of bias of the evidence base, the results of this SR are limited and should be considered a baseline for future work. The results of the meta-analysis for impacts on yields indicated that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a large, positive impact on yield (Hedge's g = 1.16 [-0.35, 2.67] (p = .13)), though there was high heterogeneity in the results (I-2 = 98.99\%, tau 2 = 2.94, Q(df = 4) = 370.7). There were positive yield impacts for soil fertility replenishment practices, including incorporating trees in agricultural fields and improved fallow practices in fields where there are severe soil fertility issues. In other cases, incorporating trees into the production system reduced productivity and took land out of production for conservation benefits. These systems generally used an incentive provision scheme to economically offset the reductions in yields. The result of the meta-analysis on income suggests that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a small, positive impact on income (Hedge's g = 0.12 [-0.06, 0.30] (p = .20)), with moderately high heterogeneity in the results (I-2 = 75.29\%, tau 2 = 0.04, Q(df = 6) = 19.16). In cases where improvement yields were reported, there were generally attendant improvements in income. In the cases where payments were provided to offset the potential loss in yields, incomes also generally improved, though there were mixed results for the certification programs and the tenure security permitting scheme. One program, which study authors suggested may have been poorly targeted, had negative yield impacts. There was not enough comparable evidence to quantitatively synthesize the impacts of agroforestry interventions on nutrition and food security outcomes, though the results indicted positive or neutral impacts on dietary diversity and food intake were likely. Surprisingly, there was little evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions on environmental outcomes, and there was no consistency of environmental indicator variables used. However, what has been studied indicates that the environmental benefits are being achieved to at least some extent, consistent with the broader literature on agroforestry practices. The evidence base was insufficient to evaluate the interaction between environmental and social impacts. Several studies explicitly considered variable impacts across different population sub-groups, including differential impacts on small-holders versus large-holders, on woman-headed households versus male-headed households, and on richer groups versus poorer groups. Small-holder farmers typically experienced the most positive effect sizes due to the agroforestry interventions. Women and poorer groups had mixed outcomes relative to men and richer households, highlighting the importance of considering these groups in intervention design. Authors' Conclusions There is limited evidence of the impacts of agroforestry interventions, restricting our ability to draw conclusions on the effect sizes of different intervention types. The existing evidence forms a baseline for future research and highlights the importance of considering equity and socio-economic factors in determining suitable intervention design. Some key implications for practice and policy include investing in programs that include pilot programs, funding for project evaluation, and that address key equity issues, such as targeting to smallholders, women, poor, and marginalized groups. Funding should also be given to implementing RCTs and more rigorous quasi-experimental impact evaluations of agroforestry interventions over longer time-periods to collect robust evidence of the effectiveness of various schemes promoting agroforestry practices.},

	abstract = {Developments in the agricultural industry are requiring dramatic in the role of the farmer away from intensive production oriented approaches towards more sustainable forms of agiculture. While this may appear to require a relatively simply change in emphasis, production based roles not only contain economic value, but contain social value in that they are used to communicate status as a 'good farmer'. Thus, when farmers are asked to change approaches to agriculture, they are not only incurring economic costs but also social costs and this is rarely, if at all, acknowledged. This study uses a symbolic interactionist framework to investigate the symbolic meaning of intensive agricultural production: how crops/livestock are perceived by farmers, how they convey status, and how they are linked with the status of the farm family within the farming community. It concludes that understanding the true meaning of agricultural activities on the farm and considering these factors in the development of policy may reduce the potential loss of established farm families from the land and the subsequent loss of decades or even centuries of experience, knowledge and local history. © European Society for Rural Sociology.},

In many places in the tropics and subtropics, livestock systems are changing rapidly, and the spatial heterogeneity of household response to change may be very large.

	abstract = {Requirements for research, practices and policies affecting soil management in relation to global food security are reviewed. Managing soil organic carbon (C) is central because soil organic matter influences numerous soil properties relevant to ecosystem functioning and crop growth. Even small changes in total C content can have disproportionately large impacts on key soil physical properties. Practices to encourage maintenance of soil C are important for ensuring sustainability of all soil functions. Soil is a major store of C within the biosphere - increases or decreases in this large stock can either mitigate or worsen climate change. Deforestation, conversion of grasslands to arable cropping and drainage of wetlands all cause emission of C; policies and international action to minimise these changes are urgently required. Sequestration of C in soil can contribute to climate change mitigation but the real impact of different options is often misunderstood. Some changes in management that are beneficial for soil C, increase emissions of nitrous oxide (a powerful greenhouse gas) thus cancelling the benefit. Research on soil physical processes and their interactions with roots can lead to improved and novel practices to improve crop access to water and nutrients. Increased understanding of root function has implications for selection and breeding of crops to maximise capture of water and nutrients. Roots are also a means of delivering natural plant-produced chemicals into soil with potentially beneficial impacts. These include biocontrol of soil-borne pests and diseases and inhibition of the nitrification process in soil (conversion of ammonium to nitrate) with possible benefits for improved nitrogen use efficiency and decreased nitrous oxide emission. The application of molecular methods to studies of soil organisms, and their interactions with roots, is providing new understanding of soil ecology and the basis for novel practical applications. Policy makers and those concerned with development of management approaches need to keep a watching brief on emerging possibilities from this fast-moving area of science. Nutrient management is a key challenge for global food production: there is an urgent need to increase nutrient availability to crops grown by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Many changes in practices including inter-cropping, inclusion of nitrogen-fixing crops, agroforestry and improved recycling have been clearly demonstrated to be beneficial: facilitating policies and practical strategies are needed to make these widely available, taking account of local economic and social conditions. In the longer term fertilizers will be essential for food security: policies and actions are needed to make these available and affordable to small farmers. In developed regions, and those developing rapidly such as China, strategies and policies to manage more precisely the necessarily large flows of nutrients in ways that minimise environmental damage are essential. A specific issue is to minimise emissions of nitrous oxide whilst ensuring sufficient nitrogen is available for adequate food production. Application of known strategies (through either regulation or education), technological developments, and continued research to improve understanding of basic processes will all play a part. Decreasing soil erosion is essential, both to maintain the soil resource and to minimise downstream damage such as sedimentation of rivers with adverse impacts on fisheries. Practical strategies are well known but often have financial implications for farmers. Examples of systems for paying one group of land users for ecosystem services affecting others exist in several parts of the world and serve as a model. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Decision support systems (DSS), like other information systems (IS) before them, were designed to serve functions deemed by 'management scientists' to be potentially useful to managers. But the unwelcome fact is that the use of agricultural DSSs by managers of farms has been low. This paper probes possible reasons for this through interpretation of agricultural DSS case histories and several strands of relevant social theory. From nine cases of DSS development effort and 14 products interpreted comparatively, a number of generalisations are made that serve as reference points in the following search for explanation in theory. First, the nature of management practice of family farms is explored and differences between the internal structure governing personal action and the scientific approach to practice are contrasted. Next, the interaction between the nature of the particular action/practice and the nature of the DSS is explored. A DSS designed to provide integrated, optimal recommendations for management typifies the DSS as a proxy for a manager's decision process. Examples of elaborate expert systems that simply were not used dramatically illustrate the resistance of family farmers to have their decision processes by-passed. On the other hand, the DSS designed to serve as a tool in a modified decision process is shown to have experienced higher use, by deriving and exploiting 'deep,' abstract information about the system, by introducing a powerful 'logic,' or a combination of both. A number of the referenced case stories demonstrate the resurgence of the decision support mode whereby the simulator is in the hands of an expert intermediary as an alternative to easy-to-use software in the hands of a farmer. This is the mode of operational research/management science, which preceded the DSS. In comparison with hierarchical organizations, available options for overcoming the persistent 'problem of implementation' of the DSS in family farms are inherently weak. This focuses attention on the importance of the relationship between the DSS developer and the potential user. Drawing on a classic typology of possible configurations of 'understanding' between the scientist and the manager, four approaches to intervention are discussed. Three entail a degree of engagement that qualifies them as 'participative.' But one of these constitutes a departure from the DSS and broader IS traditions that places it in another paradigm. In this 'mutual understanding' relationship, intervention intent shifts from educating and persuading to recognition of and respect for other ways of viewing the world. This opens up the opportunities for co-creating information systems that utilise the comparative advantages of both practical and scientific knowledge. Intervention emphasis shifts from prescribing action to facilitating learning in actions. Although the DSS has fallen far short of expectations in its influence on farm management, the experience has been instructive in multiple ways to both farmers and professionals in agriculture. In many cases, farmers learned from the DSS and could then jettison it without loss. From disappointments scientists have sometimes learned what was needed to achieve a better outcome. From collated DSS experiences, important lessons for the future can be drawn. The paper concludes by conjecturing that the future of the DSS and related ISs, while more limited than once imagined, holds promise in four directions: a 'small' tool for aiding farmers' tactical decisions; a versatile simulator as a consultant's tool; a versatile simulator as the core of a facilitated 'learning laboratory,' and a formal framework that supports regulatory objectives in constraining and documenting farming practice. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Yet to date few approaches to understand constraints and explore options for change have tackled the bewildering complexity of African farming systems. In this paper we describe the Nutrient Use in Animal and Cropping systems - Efficiencies and Scales (NUANCES) framework. NUANCES offers a structured approach to unravel and understand the complexity of African farming to identify what we term 'best-fit' technologies - technologies targeted to specific types of farmers and to specific niches within their farms. The NUANCES framework is not 'just another computer model'! We combine the tools of systems analysis and experimentation, detailed field observations and surveys, incorporate expert knowledge (local knowledge and results of research), generate databases, and apply simulation models to analyse performance of farms, and the impacts of introducing new technologies. We have analysed and described complexity of farming systems, their external drivers and some of the mechanisms that result in (in)efficient use of scarce resources. Studying sites across sub-Saharan Africa has provided insights in the trajectories of change in farming systems in response to population growth, economic conditions and climate variability (cycles of drier and wetter years) and climate change. In regions where human population is dense and land scarce, farm typologies have proven useful to target technologies between farmers of different production objectives and resource endowment (notably in terms of land, labour and capacity for investment). In such regions we could categorise types of fields on the basis of their responsiveness to soil improving technologies along soil fertility gradients, relying on local indicators to differentiate those that may be managed through 'maintenance fertilization' from fields that are highly-responsive to fertilizers and fields that require rehabilitation before yields can improved. Where human population pressure on the land is less intense, farm and field types are harder to discern, without clear patterns. Nutrient cycling through livestock is in principle not efficient for increasing food production due to increased nutrient losses, but is attractive for farmers due to the multiple functions of livestock. We identified trade-offs between income generation, soil conservation and community agreements through optimising concurrent objectives at farm and village levels. These examples show that future analyses must focus at farm and farming system level and not at the level of individual fields to achieve appropriate targeting of technologies - both between locations and between farms at any given location. The approach for integrated assessment described here can be used ex ante to explore the potential of best-fit technologies and the ways they can be best combined at farm level. The dynamic and integrated nature of the framework allows the impact of changes in external drivers such as climate change or development policy to be analysed. Fundamental questions for integrated analysis relate to the site-specific knowledge and the simplification of processes required to integrate and move from one level to the next. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We reviewed existing theories and frameworks for the uptake of agricultural innovations and found that these tend to emphasize the role of extrinsic factors such as the characteristics of the adopter and the external environment in the decision-making process. In this paper, we argue that intrinsic factors such as the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of the potential adopter towards the innovation play a key role, but this has been less studied. We present an analytical framework that combines both extrinsic and intrinsic factors in farmers' decisions to adopt new agricultural technologies and apply the framework to agroforestry adoption as a case study. We review the literature on agroforestry adoption in sub-Saharan Africa and identify the extrinsic and intrinsic variables affecting the uptake of agroforestry technologies. We conclude that the uptake of agricultural technologies is a complex process influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic variables, and recommend that future studies aiming to understand the adoption process of agricultural innovations take into account both sets of variables. A mechanistic understanding of how intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact and drive adoption can help in targeting technologies appropriately to ensure sustainability. © 2014, The Author(s).

	abstract = {The agricultural innovation systems approach emphasizes the collective nature of innovation and stresses that innovation is a co-evolutionary process, resulting from alignment of technical, social, institutional and organizational dimensions. These insights are increasingly informing interventions that focus on setting up multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as innovation platforms and networks, as mechanisms for enhancing agricultural innovation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. There has been much emphasis on how such platforms are organized, but only limited analysis unravelling how they shape co-evolution of innovation processes. This paper addresses this gap and conceptualizes platforms as intermediaries that connect the different actors in innovation systems in order to foster effective co-evolution. We present a case study of a smallholder dairy development programme in Kenya, led by a consortium of five organizations that provide a platform for building multi-actor partnerships to enhance smallholder dairy productivity and improve livelihoods. The findings indicate that co-evolution of innovation is a highly dynamic process with various interactional tensions and unexpected effects, and that the distributed nature of intermediation is important in resolving some of these tensions emerging at different actor interfaces. However, platforms are not always able to adapt adequately to emerging issues. This points to the need to look at platforms dynamically and pay more attention to mechanisms that strengthen feedback, learning and adaptive management in innovation processes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Benefits in reduced erosion and stabilized crop production may be obtained, but technical performance at field level is but one of the determinants of adoption. For various reasons, all of the CA principles are not always fully implemented by farmers and results not as favourable as expected. As with other approaches to increasing agricultural productivity, the production constraints, farmers' objectives, and the expected benefits and costs of implementing CA are important aspects that influence adoption. At farm and village levels, trade-offs in the allocation of resources become important in determining how CA may fit into a given farming system. At a regional level, factors such as the market conditions, interactions among stakeholders and other institutional and political dimensions become important. At each level, opportunities or difficulties emerge that enhance or impede development, adaptation and adoption of CA. The ex-ante identification of situations for where CA (and which form of CA) is appropriate demands research from a multi-stakeholder, multi-level, and interdisciplinary perspective.

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers continuously confront multiple social and environmental stressors that necessitate changes in livelihood strategies to prevent damages and take advantage of new opportunities, or adaptation. Vulnerability, meaning susceptibility to harm, is attributable to social determinants that limit access to assets, leading to greater exposure and sensitivity to stressors and a limited capacity to adapt. Stressors and adaptation are intertwined because stressors deplete resources available for adaptation, while adaptation may erode resources available to respond to future stressors. We present empirical evidence demonstrating the interactions of multiple stressors and adaptations over time through a case study of indigenous farmers in highland Bolivia. We examine how farmers perceive the stress on their livelihoods, their strategies for adapting to these threats, and the influence of past adaptation and exposure on vulnerability under increasing climatic change. We find that vulnerability changes over time as multiple stressors, such as land scarcity and delayed seasonal rainfall, compound, simultaneously reducing access and demanding the expenditure of household assets for adaptation, including natural capital (water and land), human capital (including labor), and financial, physical, and social capital. To reduce vulnerability over time, constraints on access to key resources must be addressed, allowing households the flexibility to reduce their exposure and improve their adaptive capacity to the multiple stressors they confront. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Today, science, policy, agro-industry and other stakeholder groups are increasingly concerned about the sustainable use of this resource, given the dissipative nature of phosphorus and difficulties in assessing, evaluating, and coping with phosphorus pollution in aquatic and terrestrial systems. We argue that predictions about a forthcoming peak, followed by a quick reduction (i.e., physical phosphate rock scarcity) are unreasoned and stress that access to phosphorus (economic scarcity) is already, and may increasingly become critical, in particular for smallholders farmers in different parts of the world. The paper elaborates on the design, development, goals and cutting-edge contributions of a global transdisciplinary process (i.e. mutual learning between science and society including multiple stakeholders) on the understanding of potential contributions and risks related to the current mode of using phosphor. us on multiple scales (Global TraPs). While taking a global and comprehensive view on the whole phosphorus-supply chain, Global TraPs organizes and integrates multiple transdisciplinary case studies to better answer questions which inform sustainable future phosphorus use. Its major goals are to contribute to four issues central to sustainable resource management: i) long-term management of biogeochemical cycles, in particular the challenge of closing the phosphorus cycle, ii) achieving food security, iii) avoiding environmental pollution and iv) sustainability learning on a global level by transdisciplinary processes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Although these changes suggest new opportunities for smallholders, too little is known about how changes will ultimately improve the wellbeing of smallholders in Ethiopia. Thus, we examine whether these changes are improving the ability of smallholders to innovate and thus improve their own welfare. In doing so, we analyze interactions between smallholders and other actors to provide new perspectives on the role played by smallholder innovation networks in the agricultural sector by drawing on data from community case studies conducted in 10 localities. Findings suggest that public extension and administration exert a strong influence over smallholder networks, potentially crowding out market-based and civil society actors, and thus limiting beneficial innovation processes. From a policy perspective, the findings suggest the need to further explore policies and programs that create more space for market and civil society to participate in smallholder innovation networks and improve welfare. From a conceptual and methodological perspective, our findings suggest the need to incorporate rigorous applications of social network analysis into the application of innovation systems theory. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In response, scholars have increasingly identified barriers to adaptation in the literature. But, despite this progress, knowledge of barriers that hamper adaptation in developing countries remains limited, especially in relation to underlying causes of vulnerability and low adaptive capacity. To further improve understanding of barriers to adaptation and identify gaps in the state-of-the-art knowledge, we undertook a synthesis of empirical literature from sub-Saharan Africa focusing on vulnerable, natural resource-dependent communities and livelihoods. Our review illustrates that: (1) local-level studies that reveal barriers to adaptation are diverse, although there is a propensity for studies on small-holder farmers; (2) many of the studies identify several barriers to adaptation, but appreciation of their interactions and compounded impacts remains scarce; and (3) most of the barriers uncovered relate broadly to biophysical, knowledge, and financial constraints on agricultural production and rural development. More hidden and under-acknowledged political, social, and psychological barriers are rarely mentioned, unless captured in studies that specifically set out to investigate these. We finish our review by highlighting gaps in understanding and by suggesting future research directions, focusing on issues of social justice. We argue that research on barriers needs to start asking why these barriers emerge, how they work together to shape adaptation processes, who they affect most, and what is needed to overcome them. © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Seasonal climate forecasts provide probabilistic information on future climate on timescales of two to three months. Where this information is not presently used it is difficult to evaluate the impact it might have. In order to justify disseminating the information to marginal groups it is important that the potential impact of the forecast is explored so that the negative and positive effects are at least partially appreciated before use of the information is widely promoted. We use an agent-based social simulation model, based on empirical evidence from field work in Lesotho, to assess the impact of using seasonal forecasts among smallholder farmers. The impact of using the forecast depends on the agents' initial household characteristics, what options they choose in responding to the forecast and the trust they place in the forecast (which in turn depends on their ability to learn and to follow their neighbours). Interaction of climate, crop productivity and social factors determines how much household-agents benefit or lose, evaluated in terms of crop yields and likelihood of exhausting food storage. Adoption of the forecast has the potential to decrease starvation among marginal household-agents but poor forecasts may do more harm than good. This work suggests that if forecasts are not correct more than 60-70\% of the time, then they are unlikely to benefit poor farmers. Poor forecasts, or forecasts that fail badly, when they do fail, lead to longer adoption timescales for forecast use. Further investigation into the impact of the forecast at the village level is encouraged before dissemination is actively pursued without appreciating potential impacts. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Aiming to translate resilience thinking theory into farming systems design practice, this paper examines fundamental properties of complex systems dynamics and their relation with the mechanisms that govern resilience and transformability in African smallholder agriculture. Agroecosystems dynamics emerge from the aggregation of diverse livelihood strategies in response to changes in the agroecosystem context, and are characterised by non-linearity, irreversibility, convergence/divergence and hysteresis. I examine a number of case studies from Africa to verify three guiding hypotheses in connection to the diversity of rural livelihood strategies: (1) diversity as alternative system regimes; (2) diversity as the result of transformability; (3) diversity determined by changing agricultural contexts. The hierarchy of constraints that determine the space for manoeuvring in agroecosystems is described through the analogy of the Matryoshka nesting dolls: each system level confines and is confined by their immediate sub- and supra-systems. Agricultural contexts, as defined by agro-ecological potential, demography and market connectivity are also dynamic and their trajectory can be described as shifts across stability domains. An example from Kenya shows that household diversity can be described as alternative system regimes, through hysteretic rather than continuous, reversible models. In some particular cases diversity emerges from divergent pathways that may have implied radical transformations in the past, as shown here for rural livelihoods in northern Cameroun. A comparative analysis of East African agroecosystems shows that thresholds in specific variables that may point to the existence of possible tipping points are rather elusive and largely site specific, requiring systematic categorisation of agricultural contexts. While agroecology needs to provide the knowledge base for the ecological intensification of smallholder landscapes, policy and market developments are needed to deal with the Matryoshka effect - or with interactions that are presumably panarchical in certain cases. Desirable shifts in farming systems can only be stimulated by working on both ends simultaneously. © 2013 The Author.},

	abstract = {Providing smallholder farmers with agricultural information could improve economic development, by helping them to grow more crops, which they could then sell for more money. Widespread mobile phone ownership in Africa means that, for the first time, there is a realistic opportunity to deliver pertinent information to remote farmers throughout the continent. Efforts to harness the potential of mobile phones include the development of agricultural market information services (MIS) – applications that send farmers crop pricing information via short message service or SMS. These services promote economic development among some farmers in the developing world, but not yet in rural Kenya. To understand what factors impede the adoption of these services, we qualitatively studied Kenyan farmers’ mobile phone usage patterns and their interactions with MFarm, a commercially available MIS. Using affordance theory to guide our analysis, we discovered a mismatch between the design of MIS and smallholder farmers’ perceptions of their mobile phones’ communication capabilities. We use these findings to motivate a design agenda that encourages software developers and development practitioners to adopt an ecological perspective when creating mobile applications for sub-Saharan Africa's rural farmers. Strategies for implementing this approach include reconsidering the design of mobile phones, and developing innovative educational interventions. © 2015 Commonwealth Secretariat.},

	abstract = {This study examines farmers' perceptions of short-and long-term variability in climate, their ability to discern trends in climate and how the perceived trends converge with actual weather observations in five districts of Eastern Province in Kenya where the climate is semi-arid with high intra-and inter-annual variability in rainfall. Field surveys to elicit farmers' perceptions about climate variability and change were conducted in Machakos, Makueni, Kitui, Mwingi and Mutomo districts. Long-term rainfall records from five meteorological stations within a 10 km radius from the survey locations were obtained from the Kenya Meteorological Department and were analysed to compare with farmers' observations. Farmers' responses indicate that they are well aware of the general climate in their location, its variability, the probabilistic nature of the variability and the impacts of this variability on crop production. However, their ability to synthesize the knowledge they have gained from their observations and discern long-term trends in the probabilistic distribution of seasonal conditions is more subjective, mainly due to the compounding interactions between climate and other factors such as soil fertility, soil water and land use change that determine the climate's overall influence on crop productivity. There is a general tendency among the farmers to give greater weight to negative impacts leading to higher risk perception. In relation to long-term changes in the climate, farmer observations in our study that rainfall patterns are changing corroborated well with reported perceptions from other places across the African continent but were not supported by the observed trends in rainfall data from the five study locations. The main implication of our findings is the need to be aware of and account for the risk during the development and promotion of technologies involving significant investments by smallholder farmers and exercise caution in interpreting farmers' perceptions about long-term climate variability and change. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

Most of these approaches tend to frame seasonal climate forecasts as a discrete product with direct and linear effects. In contrast, the authors propose that agricultural management is a performative process, constituted by a combination of planning, experimentation, and improvisation and drawing on a mix of technical expertise, situated knowledge, cumulative experience, and intuitive skill as farmers navigate a myriad of risks in the pursuit of livelihood goals and economic opportunities. This study draws on ethnographic interviews conducted with 38 family farmers in southern Georgia, examining their livelihood goals and social values, strategies for managing risk, and interactions with weather and climate information, specifically their responses to seasonal climate forecasts. Findings highlight the social nature of information processing and risk management, indicating that both material conditions and value based attitudes bear upon the ways farmers may integrate climate predictions into their agricultural management practices. These insights translate into specific recommendations that will enhance the salience, credibility, and legitimacy of seasonal climate forecasts among farmers and will promote the incorporation of such information into a skillful performance in the face of climate uncertainty. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Balancing the numerous benefits that may accrue from pesticide use on cotton, farmers face health hazards. Pesticide-induced acute symptoms significantly increased the cost-of-illness in a survey of 280 smallholder cotton growers in two districts of Zimbabwe. Cotton growers lost a mean of Z\$180 in Sanyati and Z\$316 per year in Chipinge on pesticide-related direct and indirect acute health effects. These values are equivalent to 45\% and 83\% of annual household pesticide expenditures in the two districts. The time spent recuperating from illnesses attributed to pesticides averaged 2 days in Sanyati and 4 days in Chipinge during the 1998/1999 growing season. These pesticide health cost estimates represent lower bounds only; they omit chronic pesticide health effects as well as suffering and other non-monetary costs. Acute pesticide symptoms were determined in large part by pesticide use practices, notably the lack of protective clothing. Yet many smallholder farmers misunderstood pesticide health hazards, and so did little to protect themselves. Despite the use of simple color codes, 22\% of smallholder cotton growers in Sanyati and 58\% in Chipinge did not know how the four colored triangles communicated increasing degrees of pesticide toxicity. Better farmer education in exposure averting strategies is needed. Likewise, fuller accounting for hidden health costs in future would allow farmers to make more informed decisions about agricultural pest management. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The potential for tree components of coffee agroforestry systems to provide ecosystem services is widely recognized. Management practices are a key factor in the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided. There is relatively abundant information on ecosystem services provision within agroforestry systems, but comparatively scant information regarding how coffee farmers manage their plantations, the factors influencing their farming practices and the extent to which farmers' local knowledge - as opposed to global scientific understanding - underpins management decisions. Policymakers and scientists too frequently design development programs and projects in the coffee sector. On occasion technicians are included in the design process, but farmers and their knowledge are always excluded. This research explores farmers' knowledge regarding how trees affect coffee productivity and ecosystem services in Costa Rica. Farmers' knowledge on the effects of trees on coffee productivity was compared with that of other knowledge sources: coffee processors, technicians and scientists. Farmers were shown to have detailed knowledge regarding ecosystem services that their coffee agroforestry systems provide as well as on the interactions between trees and coffee productivity. When asked on the services that trees provide, farmers classified trees according to water protection, soil formation, or contribution to biodiversity conservation. These classifications were related to tree attributes such as leaf size, biomass production or root abundance. Comparison of coffee productivity knowledge from different knowledge sources revealed considerable complementarity and little contradiction. The effects of shade trees on biophysical conditions and their interactions with coffee productivity were well understood by farmers. They recorded and classified shade trees as 'fresh' (suitable for integration with coffee) or 'hot' (unsuitable) based on their leaf texture and size, foliage density, crown shape, and root system attributes. The fresh/hot classification significantly related to positive/negative provision of services. This classification was widely used by farmers, and unknown by coffee technicians. Detailed local knowledge included several different topics, such as the role of trees in soil formation and in abundance of pollinators. Farmers were also aware of the influence of these ecosystem services on crop productivity. Generally, management decisions were made to maintain coffee productivity rather than ecosystem services. Based on these results, it is suggested that technical interventions addressing the improvement of coffee plantations are more likely to be successful if they take into account not only the scientific information on agroforestry interactions but also the knowledge possessed by farmers. Lack of comprehension of local coffee knowledge could be expected to reduce the success of development programs and projects aimed at improving productivity or other ecosystem services. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, physical and climate barriers sometimes prevent locally occurring species from spreading. China has 560 confirmed invasive alien species; 125 are insect pests, and 92 of these damage the agricultural ecosystem. The estimated annual economic loss due to alien invasive species is more than \$18.9 billion. The most harmful invasive insects exhibit some common characteristics, such as high reproduction, competitive dominance, and high tolerance, and benefit from mutualist facilitation interactions. Regional cropping system structure adjustments have resulted in mono-agricultural ecosystems in cotton and other staple crops, providing opportunities for monophagous insect pests. Furthermore, human dietary shifts to fruits and vegetables and smallholder-based farming systems result in highly diverse agricultural ecosystems, which provide resource opportunities for polyphagous insects. Multiple cropping and widespread use of greenhouses provide continuous food and winter habitats for insect pests, greatly extending their geographic range. The current management system consists of early-warning, monitoring, eradication, and spread blocking technologies. This review provides valuable new synthetic information on integrated management practices based mainly on biological control for a number of invasive species.

This study, which explored the factors that determine adoption and extent of farmers' use of the three principles of CA (i.e., minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover with crop residues, and crop rotations), was conducted in 10 target communities in 8 extension planning areas in Malawi. The primary data was collected using structured questionnaires administered to individual households. Triangulation with key informant interviews, field observations, and interactive discussions with farmers and farmer groups provided information behind contextual issues underpinning the statistical inferences. From a total of 15,854 households in the study areas, it is estimated that 18\% of the smallholder farmers had adopted CA, representing an area of about 678 ha (1,675 ac; 2.1\% of all cultivated land). Land area under CA constituted about 30\% of total cultivated land among adopters. A random sample of 151 adopters and 149 nonadopters proportional with respect to adoption rates was drawn from various communities and interviewed using structured questionnaires. A total of 30 key informant interviews were conducted with stakeholders including staff of Total Land Care, government extension workers, agroinput suppliers, and lead farmers. The first stage of the Heckman model showed that hired labor, area of land cultivated, membership to farmer group, and district influenced farmers' decisions to adopt CA. The second stage of Heckman model results suggested that total cultivated land, duration of practicing CA, and district influenced farmers' decisions to extend their land to CA. Our study can be used to show the agency and social structures that are likely to influence adoption and extent of CA. Future policy should address ways to provide access to information and long-term support to farmers to enable them to embrace the technology fully.

	abstract = {Smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa face multiple trade-offs when deciding on the allocation of their financial, labour and nutrient resources. Day-to-day decisions have implications for the sustainability of their farming system, implying multiple trade-offs between short- and long-term objectives that have biophysical and socio-economic dimensions. We show that inverse modelling techniques can be used effectively for optimisation and trade-offs analysis of farming systems. By combining the multi-objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm and a crop/soil dynamic simulation model we were able to select farming strategies that resulted in the best possible trade-offs between different farming objectives. This integrated analytical tool allows optimisation of farmers' goals similar to linear programming, but an advantage over linear programming is that the proposed method takes into account a wider spectrum of biophysical processes including their interactions and feedbacks. Tradeoffs between resource productivity, use efficiency and conservation in relation to different patterns of resource allocation were analysed for a maize-based, simplified case study farm from western Kenya (2.2 ha - comprising fields of poor, medium and high soil fertility), under three scenarios of financial liquidity to invest in labour and inputs (2000, 5000 and 10,000 KSh ha-1; 75 KSh = 1 US\$). The maximum farm-scale maize production achieved was larger when financial resources increased. However, increasing maize yields above a certain threshold by applying mineral fertilisers was associated with larger N losses by leaching, runoff and soil erosion; such threshold was 2.7 t grain ha-1 for the scenario of no financial limitations (10,000 KSh ha-1). N losses at farm scale fluctuated between 36 and 54 kg N ha-1 season-1, while the maximum maize yields achieved were around 3.4 t grain ha-1. Soil losses by erosion increased abruptly beyond a certain maize yield (e.g. 1.8 t grain ha-1 for the 2000 KSh ha-1 scenario), while the minimum rate of soil loss differed between financial scenarios. Investments in hiring labour were prioritised over fertiliser use to obtain the greatest yields and the allocation of available resources favoured the more fertile fields. This inverse modelling exercise allowed us to analyse trade-offs between different farmers' objectives and to compare potential resource allocation strategies to achieve them. The set of strategies to achieve different goals was more numerous and variable when the conditions were less conducive for farming. This questions the validity of the prevailing model of extension/communication, based on generalised recommendations for resource-poor farmers in Africa. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To improve adoption of soil productivity-enhancing technologies, two participatory methods were pursued: (i) a novel 'mother-and-baby' trial design and (ii) participatory action research with communities in a southern Malawi watershed. The central 'mother trial' was managed by researchers (replicated within a site) and systematically linked to farmer-managed 'baby' trials to cross-check biological performance with farmer assessment. The watershed approach involved a partnership of researchers and farmers addressing soil management. Technologies tested in both approaches integrated legumes into existing maize-based systems, sometimes in combination with inorganic fertilizers. Across methods, legume intensification increased yields by approximately 40\% (net benefit increase of approximately US\$50 ha-1) and fertilizer increased yields by approximately 70\% compared with continuous maize grain yields of about 1100 kg ha-1. Farmer assessment prioritized technologies that included secondary benefits, such as weed suppression, grain legume yields, and low-labour-demanding fertilizer. A survey indicated that participating researchers and extension staff had reservations about the amount of time required to interact with farmers, and no clear consensus emerged regarding the best approach. There has been wider adoption of the mother-and-baby trial method by scientists in neighbouring countries, indicating the value of systematically incorporating farmers' input.},

	abstract = {Emerging trends of a changing and increasingly variable climate have introduced new livelihood challenges in rain-fed smallholder agricultural systems that predominate in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The capacity of local farming communities and their institutions to respond to the new and emerging impacts of climate change is often constrained by lack of access to information and improved technologies, as well as poor support mechanisms to promote assimilation of new knowledge. This threatens to heighten vulnerability of the majority of SSA's rural communities who are already facing severe problems of food insecurity and a declining soil resource base. In this paper we use two case studies from Wenchi district in Ghana and Makoni in Zimbabwe to communicate how participatory action research (PAR) methodology, characterised by iterative planning-action-reflection cycles, was coupled with a new concept of field-based farmer learning centres to build adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers to climate change. The study was part of a University of Zimbabwe-led project supported under the Climate Change Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) programme to explore the state of resilience in African smallholder farming. The PAR and learning centre processes enabled communities, local leaders, and extension agents and researchers to establish the, hither to, imperceptible link between poor soil fertility and rising institutional challenges within communities. Institutional conflicts related to land tenure and sharecropping arrangements between migrant farmers and native landowners were addressed in Ghana, while local institutions supporting traditional social safety net mechanisms were revitalized in Zimbabwe. In both cases, it was apparent that farmers faced multiple stresses, at the core of which were poor and declining soil fertility and weakening local institutions. The worsening rainfall distribution and increasing cases of drought are broadening the scope for vulnerability, often driving competing claims and conflicts. PAR was successfully used as an entry point, empowering communities to self-mobilize and self-organize to co-learn and experiment with integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies and other improved farming practices. They realised opportunities for achieving high crop yields and generate surpluses in good years. Strengthening local institutional capacity to revitalise community safety nets proved an essential ingredient for enhancing adaptive capacity of smallholders to climatic shocks. The PAR process was a major driver of effective partnerships among community members, extension, policy makers and researchers, but ensuing success generated a new set of social challenges that could not be addressed within the short timescale of the project. We conclude that PAR was a suitable mechanism for supporting self-organization and co-learning processes among smallholder farmers and their service providers, enabling them to use ISFM technologies and strengthen their local institutions around natural resource management. This revealed the scope for building adaptive capacity of these communities against climate change and variability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how double exposure to economic and environmental stressors - and the interaction between the two - affect smallholder farmers in Mozambique's Limpopo River Basin. Studying two case study villages we find that people, in general, are resilient to environmental stressors. However, most households show less resilience to the socioeconomic stressors and shocks that have been introduced or intensified by economic globalisation. Our findings indicate that economic change brought about by structural adjustment policies pressures rural people to alter their approach to farming, which makes it more difficult for them to respond to environmental change. For example, smallholder farmers find it difficult to make a transition to commercial farming within the Limpopo Basin, in part because farming techniques that are well adapted to managing environmental variability in the region - such as seeding many small plots - are not well suited to the economies of scale needed for profitable commercial agriculture. People use a variety of strategies to cope with interactive environmental and economic stressors and shocks, but many face considerable constraints to profitably exploiting market-based opportunities. We conclude that economic stressors and shocks may now be causing small-scale agriculture to be less well adapted to ecological and climate variability, making smallholders more vulnerable to future climate change. Some local level policy interventions, including those that support and build on local environmental knowledge, could assist rural agricultural societies in adapting to future environmental change in the context of economic globalisation. © 2009 The Author(s).

Farmers in two case study communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal face high transaction costs as reflected primarily in their low levels of education and literacy, lack of market information, insecure property rights, poor road and communication infrastructure, and long distances to markets. Analysis of the reasons why cooperatives were originally established in various parts of the world suggests that most of the causes (such as poverty, market failure and high transaction costs) also apply to the study farmers, as do the seven international principles of cooperation. Smallholder farmers in both case study regions have the potential to grow high-value crops such as vegetables, fruit and cut flowers. In the supply chain from farm to market, the optimum boundary for each organization involved in the chain (e.g. cooperative and investor-oriented firm) depends on the minimum operational and transaction costs for each business.},

	abstract = {Policy measures regarding adaptation to climate change include efforts to adjust socio-economic and ecologic systems. Colombia has undertaken various measures in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation since becoming a party of the Kyoto protocol in 2001 and a party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. The first national communication to the UNFCCC stated how Colombian agriculture will be severely impacted under different emission scenarios and time frames. The analyses in this document further support that climate change will severely threaten the socioeconomics of Colombian agriculture. We first query national data sources to characterize the agricultural sector. We then use 17 Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural production may be affected by climate change, and show the expected changes to years 2040-2069 ("2050") under the A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A2) and the overall trends in both precipitation and temperature to 2100. We then evaluate expected changes within different regions and measure the proportion of area affected within each crop's distributional range. By 2050, climatic change in Colombia will likely impact 3. 5 million people, 14 \% of national GDP corresponding to agriculture, employment of 21 \% of the population, agro-industries, supply chains, and food and nutritional security. If no adaptation measures are taken, 80 \% of crops would be impacted in more than 60 \% of their current areas of cultivation, with particularly severe impacts in high value perennial and exportable crops. Impacts also include soil degradation and organic matter losses in the Andes hillsides; likely flooding in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts; niche losses for coffee, fruit, cocoa, and bananas; changes in prevalence of pests and diseases; and increases in the vulnerabilities of non-technically developed smallholders. There is, however, still time to change the current levels of vulnerability if a multidisciplinary focus (i. e., agronomic, economic, and social) in vulnerable sectors is undertaken. Each sub-sector and the Government need to invest in: (1) data collection, (2) detailed, regionally-based impact assessments, (3) research and development, and (4) extension and technology transfer. Support to vulnerable smallholders should be given by the state in the form of agricultural insurance systems contextualized under the phenomenon of climate change. A national coordination scheme led by (but not restricted to) the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) with the contributions of national and international institutions is needed to address agricultural adaptation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Crop intensification through subsidies could have indirect impacts through gains/losses in income and purchasing power, as well as direct influences on local availability. An integrated household survey conducted multiple times in Malawi provided evidence-based insights into the complex interactions between agriculture and nutrition. The nationally representative dataset indicated that agricultural input subsidies did not preclude crop or dietary diversity. Two pathways of subsidy impact appeared to be operating: an association with diversified cropping for a direct influence on available food quality; and an association with adoption of modern maize varieties for an indirect influence through commercialization and income that supports diverse food purchases. Although crop diversity was positively associated with dietary diversity, we found that education, income, market access, and availability of improved storage technologies had higher influence on dietary diversity. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the need for complementary investments in both education and employment creation, particularly for female heads of households. © 2014, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Small-holder farmers in Ethiopia are facing several climate related hazards, in particular highly variable rainfall with severe droughts which can have devastating effects on their livelihoods. Projected changes in climate are expected to aggravate the existing challenges. This study examines farmer perceptions on current climate variability and long-term changes, current adaptive strategies, and potential barriers for successful further adaptation in two case study regions - the Central Rift Valley (CRV) and Kobo Valley. The study was based on a household questionnaire, interviews with key stakeholders, and focus group discussions. The result revealed that about 99 \% of the respondents at the CRV and 96 \% at the Kobo Valley perceived an increase in temperature and 94 \% at CRV and 91 \% at the Kobo Valley perceived a decrease in rainfall over the last 20-30 years. Inter-annual and intraseasonal rainfall variability also has increased according to the farmers. The observed climate data (1977-2009) also showed an increasing trend in temperature and high inter-annual and intra-seasonal rainfall variability. In contrast to farmers' perceptions of a decrease in rainfall totals, observed rainfall data showed no statistically significant decline. The interaction among various bio-physical and socio-economic factors, changes in rainfall intensity and reduced water available to crops due to increased hot spells, may have influenced the perception of farmers with respect to rainfall trends. In recent decades, farmers in both the CRV and Kobo have changed farming practices to adapt to perceived climate change and variability, for example, through crop and variety choice, adjustment of cropping calendar, and in situ moisture conservation. These relatively low-cost changes in farm practices were within the limited adaptation capacity of farmers, which may be insufficient to deal with the impacts of future climate change. Anticipated climate change is expected to impose new risks outside the range of current experiences. To enable farmers to adapt to these impacts critical technological, institutional, and market-access constraints need to be removed. Inconsistencies between farmers' perceptions and observed climate trends (e.g., decrease in annual rainfall) could lead to sub-optimal or counterproductive adaptations, and therefore must be removed by better communication and capacity building, for example through Climate Field Schools. Enabling strategies, which are among others targeted at agricultural inputs, credit supply, market access, and strengthening of local knowledge and information services need to become integral part of government policies to assist farmers to adapt to the impacts of current and future climate change. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

An international research project investigated the smallholder agrobiodiversity of maize (corn) in a global hotspot (Bolivia) undergoing significant intensification. Peach-based intensification was pronounced (300-400\%) and prolonged (2000-2010) in study areas. Intensification and maize agrobiodiversity were found to co-occur within smallholder landscapes. Interactions of these field systems did not trigger land-change tipping points leading to landrace extirpation. By 2010 maize landraces in the study areas still demonstrated high levels of taxonomic and ecological biodiversity and contributed significantly to this crop's agrobiodiversity at national (31\%) and hemispheric (3\%) scales. Social and ecological resilience and in situ conservation of the maize agrobiodiversity by Bolivian smallholders was enabled through robust linkages to off-farm migration; resource access and asset capabilitiesamong both traditional and nontraditional growers; landrace agroecology and food uses; and innovative knowledge and skills. The smallholders' resilience resulting from these linkages was integral to the conditional success of the in situ conservation of maize agrobiodiversity. Environment-development interactions both enabled smallholders' agrobiodiversity resilience and influenced the limits and vulnerability of agrobiodiversity. Scientific policy recommendations regarding land-use planning and sustainability analysis are targeted to specific Río+20 priorities for agrobiodiversity.},

Despite these known benefits, there is still limited understanding on how shade trees affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services at the same time and the potential trade-offs or synergies among them. To fill this knowledge gap, we quantified four major ecosystem services (regulation of pests and diseases; provisioning of agroforestry products; maintenance of soil fertility; and carbon sequestration) in 69 coffee agroecosystems belonging to smallholder farmers under a range of altitudes (as representative of environmental conditions) and management conditions, in the region of Turrialba, Costa Rica. We first analyzed the individual effects of altitude, types of shade and management intensity and their interactions on the provision of ecosystem services. In order to identify potential trade-offs and synergies, we then analyzed bivariate relationships between different ecosystem services, and between individual ecosystem services and plant biodiversity. We also explored which types of shade provided better levels of ecosystem services. The effectiveness of different types of shade in providing ecosystem services depended on their interactions with altitude and coffee management, with different ecosystem services responding differently to these factors. No trade-offs were found among the different ecosystem services studied or between ecosystem services and biodiversity, suggesting that it is possible to increase the provision of multiple ecosystem services at the same time. Overall, both low and highly diversified coffee agroforestry systems had better ability to provide ecosystem services than coffee monocultures in full sun. Based on our findings, we suggest that coffee agroforestry systems should be designed with diversified, productive shade canopies and managed with a medium intensity of cropping practices, with the aim of ensuring the continued provision of multiple ecosystem services. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

We focused on the choice of more complex integrated indicator-based tools at the farm level. The objective was to determine key characteristics as criteria for tool choice. This was done with an in-depth comparison of 2 cases: the Monitoring Tool for Integrated Farm Sustainability and the Public Goods Tool. They differ in characteristics that may influence tool choice: data, time, and budgetary requirements. With an enhanced framework, we derived 11 key characteristics to describe differences between the case tools. Based on the key characteristics, we defined 2 types of indicator-based tools: full sustainability assessment (FSA) and rapid sustainability assessment (RSA). RSA tools are more oriented toward communicating and learning. They are therefore more suitable for use by a larger group of farmers, can help to raise awareness, trigger farmers to become interested in sustainable farming, and highlight areas of good or bad performance. If and when farmers increase their commitment to on-farm sustainability, they can gain additional insight by using an FSA tool. Based on complementary and modular use of the tools, practical recommendations for the different end users, i.e., researchers, farmers, advisers, and so forth, have been suggested. © 2014 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {We estimate the potential value of general circulation model (GCM)-based seasonal precipitation forecasts for maize planting and fertilizer management decisions at two semi-arid locations (Katumani and Makindu) in Southern Kenya. Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. October-February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions - representing upper and lower bounds of predictability - and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15-30\% of the average gross value of production and 24-69\% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. GCM predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24\% at Katumani and 9\% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the study's assumptions, despite high probability (25\% at Katumani, 34\% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This article is a commentary on several research studies conducted on the prospects for aerobic rice production systems that aim at reducing the demand for irrigation water which in certain major rice producing areas of the world is becoming increasingly scarce. The research studies considered, as reported in published articles mainly under the aegis of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), have a narrow scope in that they test only 3 or 4 rice varieties under different soil moisture treatments obtained with controlled irrigation, but with other agronomic factors of production held as constant. Consequently, these studies do not permit an assessment of the interactions among agronomic factors that will be of critical significance to the performance of any production system. Varying the production factor of "water" will seriously affect also the levels of the other factors required to optimise the performance of a production system. The major weakness in the studies analysed in this article originates from not taking account of the interactions between experimental and non-experimental factors involved in the comparisons between different production systems. This applies to the experimental field design used for the research studies as well as to the subsequent statistical analyses of the results. The existence of such interactions is a serious complicating element that makes meaningful comparisons between different crop production systems difficult. Consequently, the data and conclusions drawn from such research readily become biased towards proposing standardised solutions for possible introduction to farmers through a linear technology transfer process. Yet, the variability and diversity encountered in the real-world farming environment demand more flexible solutions and approaches in the dissemination of knowledge-intensive production practices through "experiential learning" types of processes, such as those employed by farmer field schools. This article illustrates, based on expertise of the 'system of rice intensification' (SRI), that several cost-effective and environment-friendly agronomic solutions to reduce the demand for irrigation water, other than the asserted need for the introduction of new cultivars, are feasible. Further, these agronomic solutions can offer immediate benefits of reduced water requirements and increased net returns that would be readily accessible to a wide range of rice producers, particularly the resource poor smallholders. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Abstract In the absence of adequate extension services, retailers have become the major information source for farmers' pesticide use in rural China. Pesticide application for smallholders is rather complex, and mistakes can lead to significant crop losses. Farmers, therefore, seek sources of information regarding pesticide use. This paper first explores how different kinds of retailers may employ different strategies of providing information to farmers. We find that for village, town, and county retailers, the more familiar they are with farmers, the more likely they are to amplify the recommended dosage of pesticide use. In cooperatives, who buy pesticides from an extension station, the information is directly transferred to member farmers without information distortion. Apart from examining retailers' different strategies of information provision, this paper also asks in how far farmers' trust in retailers may affect pesticide use. It finds that trust in different kinds of retailers indeed varies and plays a critical role in converting information into farming behavior. Members of the cooperative show rather high levels of trust in their retailer, while farmers who are not members of a cooperative show low levels of trust in retailers. Pesticide use is a joint result of retailers' information provision strategies and farmers' trust. The lowest pesticide use occurs when accurate information is provided and when farmers highly trust the information provider. Overuse occurs with either information distortion or low levels of trust. Cooperatives have advantages both in terms of information provision and trust, thereby leading to the lowest use of pesticides. © 2014 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.},

This paper discusses how fodder technologies and knowledge have been introduced and integrated in diverse livestock production systems in Ethiopia, Syria and Vietnam. A synthesis of lessons learnt shows that fodder innovation is triggered and diffused by actors interacting and learning in networks, and on farms. Fodder innovation, being only one element of livestock value chains, is sustainably enhanced when linked to other innovations and market-oriented activities that optimize productivity gains. Yet innovating smallholder farmers face systemic constraints to access markets, and need to organize in groups to exploit opportunities. The paper concludes that rather than treating innovation systems and value chain approaches to agricultural development as separate tools, the integration of their complementary features enhances smallholders' innovation and market success. © The Author 2012.

	abstract = {The use of agent-based modelling approaches in ex-post and ex-ante evaluations of agricultural policies has been progressively increasing over the last few years. There are now a sufficient number of models that it is worth taking stock of the way these models have been developed. Here, we review 20 agricultural agent-based models (ABM) addressing heterogeneous decision-making processes in the context of European agriculture. The goals of this review were to i) develop a framework describing aspects of farmers’ decision-making that are relevant from a farm-systems perspective, ii) reveal the current state-of-the-art in representing farmers’ decision-making in the European agricultural sector, and iii) provide a critical reflection of underdeveloped research areas and on future opportunities in modelling decision-making. To compare different approaches in modelling farmers’ behaviour, we focused on the European agricultural sector, which presents a specific character with its family farms, its single market and the common agricultural policy (CAP). We identified several key properties of farmers’ decision-making: the multi-output nature of production; the importance of non-agricultural activities; heterogeneous household and family characteristics; and the need for concurrent short- and long-term decision-making. These properties were then used to define levels and types of decision-making mechanisms to structure a literature review. We find most models are sophisticated in the representation of farm exit and entry decisions, as well as the representation of long-term decisions and the consideration of farming styles or types using farm typologies. Considerably fewer attempts to model farmers’ emotions, values, learning, risk and uncertainty or social interactions occur in the different case studies. We conclude that there is considerable scope to improve diversity in representation of decision-making and the integration of social interactions in agricultural agent-based modelling approaches by combining existing modelling approaches and promoting model inter-comparisons. Thus, this review provides a valuable entry point for agent-based modellers, agricultural systems modellers and data driven social scientists for the re-use and sharing of model components, code and data. An intensified dialogue could fertilize more coordinated and purposeful combinations and comparisons of ABM and other modelling approaches as well as better reconciliation of empirical data and theoretical foundations, which ultimately are key to developing improved models of agricultural systems. © 2018},

The role of the smallholder farmer community in soil fertility evaluation and management was examined from two 'research for development' projects in northern Tanzania. These are the African Highlands Initiative (AHI) and the Soil Water Management Research Group (SWMRG). Participatory approaches were applied by both projects. Farmers' experience and knowledge of local indicators of soil quality were used in identifying soil fertility constraints and in generating resource flow maps. The farmers' evaluation of soil fertility was compared with soil analytical data and with calculations of maize yields by the model QUEFTS. Farmers' indigenous knowledge in soil fertility evaluation mostly agreed with laboratory analysis and model calculations by QUEFTS. Model calculations identified potassium as the most limiting nutrient in the highlands in northeastern Tanzania for yields less than 3 t ha-1 and phosphorus for yields higher than 4 t ha-1. In Maswa (Lake Victoria Basin) nitrogen was most limiting. Given that farmers' evaluation of soil fertility is relative to what they see around them, there is a need to verify their observations, but also the interpretation of laboratory data by models like QUEFTS requires continuous and critical validation. Both projects have shown that there is scope to reverse the trends of declining soil fertility in smallholder farms in northern Tanzania. Essential was that the interaction with scientists has built confidence in the farmers because their knowledge in addressing soil fertility constraints was recognized. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Professional plant breeders have had much difficulty developing modern varieties that outperform farmers' traditional varieties in these environments, in part because of an incomplete understanding of why farmers choose the varieties they grow. Improved understanding of farmers' varietal choices can contribute to collaboration between farmers and formal plant breeders. Based on a 15-month field study in Dissan, Mali, we examine farmer's choices among their traditional sorghum varieties in terms of one or more than one variety, and short-cycle or long-cycle varieties, and the interaction between these two choices. Results support our general hypothesis that farmers choose varieties to optimize outputs in the face of variation in the growing environment and in human managed inputs such as labor and tools. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

	abstract = {As the sustainability of agricultural citizen science projects depends on volunteer farmers who contribute their time, energy and skills, understanding their motivation is important to attract and retain participants in citizen science projects. The objectives of this study were to assess 1) farmers' motivations to participate as citizen scientists and 2) farmers' mobile telephone usage. Building on motivational factors identified from previous citizen science studies, a questionnaire based methodology was developed which allowed the analysis of motivational factors and their relation to farmers' characteristics. The questionnaire was applied in three communities of farmers, in countries from different continents, participating as citizen scientists. We used statistical tests to compare motivational factors within and among the three countries. In addition, the relations between motivational factors and farmers characteristics were assessed. Lastly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to group farmers based on their motivations. Although there was an overlap between the types of motivations, for Indian farmers a collectivistic type of motivation (i.e., contribute to scientific research) was more important than egoistic and altruistic motivations. For Ethiopian and Honduran farmers an egoistic intrinsic type of motivation (i.e., interest in sharing information) was most important. While fun has appeared to be an important egoistic intrinsic factor to participate in other citizen science projects, the smallholder farmers involved in this research valued 'passing free time' the lowest. Two major groups of farmers were distinguished: one motivated by sharing information (egoistic intrinsic), helping (altruism) and contribute to scientific research (collectivistic) and one motivated by egoistic extrinsic factors (expectation, expert interaction and community interaction). Country and education level were the two most important farmers' characteristics that explain around 20\% of the variation in farmers motivations. For educated farmers, contributing to scientific research was a more important motivation to participate as citizen scientists compared to less educated farmers. We conclude that motivations to participate in citizen science are different for smallholders in agriculture compared to other sectors. Citizen science does have high potential, but easy to use mechanisms are needed. Moreover, gamification may increase the egoistic intrinsic motivation of farmers. © 2017 Beza et al.

Many development initiatives focus on the enhancement of smallholder production and productivity because the majority of poor people in developing countries live in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood. The consequences of these development initiatives need to be assessed before implementation to reduce the risk of possible negative impacts. This can be done by applying ex ante sustainability impact assessment. Here, we compare methods of assessment of sustainability impact for farming interventions. We review methodological approaches and verify whether the requirements of sustainability impact assessment theory are fulfilled. Our major points are the following: (1) main methodological approaches do not fulfill the requirements defined in the theoretical sustainability impact assessment discourse. (2) The active involvement of different stakeholder groups throughout the assessment process and the possibility of learning and exchange are fundamental to sustainability impact assessment. (3) The institutional dimension of sustainability is not yet sufficiently integrated. We therefore suggest institutional criteria and indicators to be also considered in the sustainability impact assessment framework. We argue that sustainability impact assessment, respecting the interactive involvement of all stakeholder groups throughout the whole process, is a compulsory element in project planning for a sustainable agricultural development in developing countries. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

	abstract = {Rural land consolidation has been a very important and efficient development tool all over the world for a century and is now an indispensable instrument for rural sustainable development in China. The Chinese central government has devoted large sums of money to rural consolidation projects each year in an effort to help protect cultivated land, to improve agricultural production, to enhance the socio-economic development of rural communities, and to help build rural landscapes. However, little attention has been paid to evaluating the performance of land consolidation projects from the view of community members, which is sorely needed. Household satisfaction with land consolidation projects is a key indicator of consolidation performance. Understanding the factors that influence household satisfaction is an effective way of dealing with problems in the interactions between land restructuring and human behaviors in rural areas and can help improve project performance. This paper examines the performance of land consolidation in terms of rural households’ levels of satisfaction in rural China and analyses the most influential factors of satisfaction. Data were gathered via questionnaires and analyzed with a probit model. Results indicated three significant points. First, overall satisfaction rate was 76.5\%, meaning that most rural households in the regions of Hangzhou, Changsha, and Guiyang were satisfied with land consolidation projects. Second, 11 factors significantly affected rural residents’ satisfaction with consolidation. These factors included farmers’ level of education, employment characteristics, family size, input level of agricultural production, agricultural produce transportation methods, level of agricultural mechanization, the characteristics of land transfer in the village and within their own families, the perceived importance of land consolidation, their level of social insurance support, and their participation in rural production cooperatives. Third, six of these factors had positive effects on performance; four had negative effects, and one (employment characteristics) demonstrated a significant influence. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Mothers identified cultural factors influencing their decision to mix-feed their babies, which included 1) pressures by village elders and families to supplement because it is a traditional practice, 2) belief that breast milk is an incomplete food that does not increase the infants weight, 3) belief that all family members should receive the benefit of food grown in the family farm, and 4) the taboo of prohibiting sexual contact during breastfeeding. © 2005 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

Livestock keeping, an important livelihood strategy for smallholder farmers in Africa, is a major consumer of water, and its water consumption is increasing with increasing demands for livestock products. At the same time, current low returns from livestock keeping limit its contribution to livelihoods, threaten environmental health and aggravate local conflicts. The objectives of this review are to: (1) synthesize available knowledge in the various components of the livestock and water sectors in sub-Saharan Africa, (2) analyze livestock-water interactions and (3) identify promising strategies and technological interventions for improved livestock water productivity (LWP) using a framework for mixed crop-livestock systems. The interventions are grouped in three categories related to feed, water, and animal management. Feed related strategies for improving LWP include choosing feed types carefully, improving feed quality, increasing feed water productivity, and implementing grazing management practices. Water management for higher LWP comprises water conservation, watering point management, and integration of livestock production in irrigation schemes. Animal management strategies include improving animal health and careful animal husbandry. Evidence indicates that successful uptake of interventions can be achieved if institutions, policies, and gender are considered. Critical research and development gaps are identified in terms of methodologies for quantifying water productivity at different scales and improving integration between agricultural sectors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Current efforts to promote integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) for improved productivity of staple cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa have paid little attention to soil micronutrient deficiencies under smallholder farming. This has not only compromised yields, but also undermined the nutritional quality of harvested grains. To address this knowledge gap, a study was carried out over two cropping seasons in Hwedza district in eastern Zimbabwe to assess the added grain yield and nutritional benefits of zinc (Zn) fertilizer application to maize (Zea mays L.) under different ISFM options. In all cases, Zn application resulted in added maize grain and quality benefits. Application of Zn (11kgha-1) in combination with organic nutrient resources (5tha-1), and mineral fertilizers (90kg Nha-1 and 26kg Pha-1) gave the highest maize grain yields of up to 3.9tha-1; which translated to 1.3 times more yield than under sole mineral NPK fertilizers. In the subsequent season, there were significantly higher residual effects (2tha-1) from organic xZn combinations compared with sole mineral fertilizer treatments. Organic nutrient resources and Zn application significantly (P\&lt;0.05) influenced maize grain P and Zn concentration, with cattle manure consistently producing the highest grain P concentrations of 0.44\%. Maize grain under combinations of mineral NPK, Zn and leaf litter gave the highest grain Zn concentration of up to 35mgkg-1. The Zn-based treatments increased grain Zn concentration and yield by 67 and 29\%, respectively, indicating that there was much more benefit in grain quality than just yield after external Zn application. Combined organic resource and Zn fertilization also resulted in a significant build up of plant available soil P and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extractable Zn. Concentrations of 7.4mg Pkg-1 and 5.5mg Znkg-1 were measured after application of organics, compared with initial values of 5.2mgkg-1 and 1.15mgkg-1, respectively. It was concluded that benefits of ISFM options currently promoted in smallholder farming systems in Zimbabwe are constrained by soil Zn deficiencies. Combining these ISFM options with Zn fertilizer formulations increased yields and grain quality of the staple maize, enhancing scope for agronomic fortification of maize to enhance human nutrition. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The theme of biodiversity and society provides an opportunity to look beyond skewed environmental ideologies that impel biodiversity researchers to ignore land "tarnished" by humans in search of "pristine" ecosystems. Data reported and analyzed in this paper test and draw conclusions based on a non-partisan stance that recognizes biodiversity as a product of complex natural and anthropogenic interactions. The data in this paper describes this process in the Amazon floodplain of sector Muyuy, Peru. A smallholder tradition of adaptive change in this highly precarious and unstable landscape provides a dynamic foundation upon which biodiversity is produced, managed and conserved. To examine this tradition of appropriate response to change, data was collected on land-cover dynamics using Landsat images and biodiversity inventories and household surveys of resource use technologies and conservation practices were carried out. Through complex agricultural technologies, sector Muyuy smallholders, known as ribereños, use a highly differentiated and dynamic environment to produce a great diversity of crops while creating habitats for endangered and over-exploited species of fish and river turtles, plants, and other species. Ribereños are smallholder farmers, fishermen and forest managers. They are the descendents of several indigenous groups as well as migrants from Europe, Asia and Africa. Most of the rural inhabitants of Peruvian Amazonia are ribereños. In Muyuy, we found that ribereños manage an average of 76 tree species per ha, including tropical cedar and other over-exploited timber species. We conclude that meaningful attempts at biodiversity conservation must begin at the interface between ecological and social processes and incorporate locally developed knowledge and practice.

	abstract = {Many smallholder breeding programs in developing countries failed because of neglecting basic conditions, particularly the no involvement of farmers in a participatory manner from design to the implementation phase of the programs. Inadequate centralized breeding plans to improve local breeds and various plans prescribing crossbreeding with European highly producing breeds, failed. Though some nucleus breeding programs were successful and attained some sustainability if the farmers' participation was considered, they still are vulnerable once the funding provided ends. An evolving approach, emerging from participatory research experiences, involves community-based breeding programs for smallholder farmers in low-input systems. These are being implemented in pilot research sites with promising results and already rendering lessons learned that merit consideration in relation with the sustainability of a program. The paper discusses important factors for the success of these programs. Farmers' participation along with main issues for program implementation are highlighted in relation to site selection, the communication processes, recording schemes, role of scientists, the institutionalisation of cooperation and the enabling environment. Finally, ongoing case studies of successful community-based breeding programs are mentioned. Shortcomings in farmers' participation require attention and institutional strengthening for effective application of participatory tools and knowledge exchange between farmers and researchers. But participatory research alone is not the sole prescription for success. No matter how participatory the plans will be, they will always depend on technical support and institutional support for data collection, analysis and feedback. This is hindered because of the short-term projection of funding for research projects. An important issue relates to the out scaling of successful experiences at project level that benefits only a limited number of farmers. The only avenue to guarantee sustainability is that government priorities (local or national) emphasize community-based breeding as a viable alternative for smallholder improvement on a long-term basis, and development and appropriate policies provide the enabling environment for realization and adoption at a large scale. Under these conditions research will have an advisory and facilitating role whereas ownership of the program will go to the community-level. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

A large proportion of the population uses this form of treatment for primary health care and for the treatment of ailments in their livestock. Livestock is a major asset for resource-poor smallholder farmers and pastoralists throughout the world and internal parasites are recognized by these communities as having an impact on livestock health. Parasitic infections are among those infections that traditional healers confidently treat and against which an enormous variety of remedies exist. Many of these are based on the use of plant preparations. Although various methods have been used for the validation of traditional phytomedical preparations, there is a lack of standardization of these procedures. The present study is aimed at providing an overview of ethnoveterinary deworming preparations, the various methods that have been used in their validation and the future prospects for their use against helminth parasites of ruminant livestock in developing countries, with an emphasis on nematode parasites. Recommendations are made on the procedures that should be followed to conduct in vivo and in vitro assays. Fostering better interaction between traditional healers and scientists is advocated to prevent harmful overexploitation, both of local knowledge and of plant species that may have effects against nematode parasites.},

This study explores an often overlooked dimension of multifunctionality by examining different recreational services provided by landowners in Missouri and analyzing the relationship between recreational multifunctionality and the practice of agroforestry. The latter provides multiple economic, environmental and beautification benefits that involve trees in the landscape. Results show that family farms provide several recreational services for their household members and others, and the existence of synergies between the recreational function of the farmland and agroforestry practices, consistent with the transition to strong multifunctionality. The recreational use of the land is positively associated to the cognitive (i.e., perceived knowledge) and affective (i.e., willingness to adopt) attitudes towards agroforestry. Results also show that the higher the perception of intrinsic (i.e., planting trees for wind protection and carbon sequestration) and economic (i.e., perceived economic benefits and flood protection) values of agroforestry, the more recreational use of the land. This study exemplifies the interactions between two little examined farmland functions providing insights for a comprehensive value assessment of family farms.

	abstract = {Purpose: Malawi's current extension policy supports pluralism and advocates responsiveness to farmer demand. We investigate whether smallholder farmers' experience supports the assumption that access to multiple service providers leads to extension and advisory services that respond to the needs of farmers. Design/methodology/approach: Within a case study approach, two villages were purposively selected for in-depth qualitative analysis of available services and farmers' experiences. Focus group discussions were held separately with male and female farmers in each village, followed by semi-structured interviews with 12 key informants selected through snowball sampling. Transcripts were analysed by themes, and summaries of themes were made from cross-case analysis. Findings: Farmers appreciate having access to a variety of sources of technical advice and enterprise-specific technology. However, most service providers continue to dominate and dictate what they will offer. Market access remains a challenge, as providers still emphasize pushing a particular technology to increase farm productivity rather than addressing farmers' expressed needs. Although farmers work in groups, providers do not seek to strengthen these to enable active interaction and to link them to input and produce markets. This limits farmers' capacity to continue with innovations after service providers pull out. Poor coordination between providers limits exploitation of potential synergies amongst actors. Practical Implications: Services providers can adapt their approach to engage farmers in discussion of their needs and work collaboratively to address them. At a system level, institutions that have a coordination function can play a more dynamic role in brokering interaction between providers and farmers to ensure coverage and responsiveness. Originality/Value: The study provides a new farmer perspective on the implementation of extension reforms. © 2013 Copyright Wageningen University.},

	abstract = {Background: Helminth infections in small ruminants are serious problems in the developing world, particularly where nutrition and sanitation are poor. This study investigated the burden and risk factors of gastrointestinal nematode parasite infections in sheep and goats kept in smallholder mixed farms in the Kenyan Central Highlands. Three hundred and seven small ruminants were sampled from 66 smallholder mixed farms in agro-ecological zones 1 (humid) and 3 (semi-humid) in the Kenyan Central highlands. The farms were visited once a month for eight months during which a health and production survey questionnaire was administered. Fecal samples were collected at each visit from each animal. Fecal egg counts (FEC) were performed using the modified McMaster technique. Associations between potential risk factors and FEC were assessed using 3- level Poisson models fit in SAS using GLIMMIX macro. Correlations among repeated observations were adjusted for using three different correlation structures. Results: A rise in FEC was observed two months after the onset of rains. Farmer education, age category, de-worming during the preceding month and grazing system were significant predictors of FEC. Additionally, there were significant interactions between grazing system and both deworming and age category implying that the effect of grazing system is dependent on both deworming status and age category; and that the effect of de-worming depends on the grazing system. The most important predictors of FEC in the study area were grazing system, de-worming status and education of the farmers. Conclusion: Since several factors were important predictors of FEC, controlling gastrointestinal helminths of small ruminants in these resource-poor smallholder mixed farms requires a sustainable integrated helminth control strategy that includes adoption of zero-grazing and more farmer education probably through extension services. Achieving improved helminth controls in these resource-poor farming systems offers an opportunity to increase small ruminant productivity and hence has a potential of improving the livelihood of the resource-poor farmers. © 2007 Odoi et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years, the multifunctionality of tropical mountain rural landscapes has been encouraged to enhance the provision of numerous commodities, as well as ecological and cultural services. However, globalization and neoliberal policies have boosted agricultural production for global markets and simultaneously marginalized fundamental rural activities related to self-supply agriculture. This trend has modified smallholder livelihoods from being mostly agricultural to becoming increasingly wage-labor oriented. This shift in household income feeds back to land use configuration and landscape function. We examined origins, development and current states of farmer livelihoods and associated land use and cover changes that occurred in a tropical watershed landscape of the Huasteca Potosina in Mexico between 1970 and 2009. For this purpose, we adopted the Drylands Development Paradigm (DDP) as our analytical framework (Reynolds et al., 2007). Based on aerial photographs and interviews applied to farmers and key stakeholders, we identified local, regional, national and international socio-economic and biophysical drivers that led to current livelihood diversification in several communities sharing the same watershed, and the extent and rate of land use change that has occurred over the past 40 years. We found an increasingly fragmented landscape with a diverse mosaic of land use types (citrus, sugarcane,. milpa and secondary forests) yet increasingly dominated by citrus plantations. This reflects an intergeneration livelihood transition towards land use decisions driven by the interaction of diverse and contrasting rural development policies, changing markets, price fluctuations and extreme climatic events. We suggest that the diversity of livelihood strategies and land use types is dynamic and continuously in transition; this creates a complex and changing landscape. The watershed landscape has responded to global markets at the cost of local needs, knowledge systems and social networks. Thus, landscape multifunctionality, preservation of ecosystem services and human well being could be at stake under current trends of globalization and global environmental change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

For most of the 10 million people who live in this region, farming is principally a way of life, not a commercial activity. A number of traditional, new and adapted intervention techniques for water harvesting and soil conservation are known in the SADC region which all aim to alleviate the most limiting crop production factors: water and soil fertility. Some of these techniques have already been researched or even implemented. This paper summarizes and highlights the major findings of such research and experiences. Socio-economic factors are considered as well as their interaction with intervention measures such as tillage methods including traditional systems, mulching and crop residue management techniques and crop selection and intercropping. The influences of termite induced micro-topography and weed competition on water harvesting and conservation are also considered. Constraints on the successful improvement or insurance of crop production in semi-arid areas of SADC are identified. Although further research will be required in certain areas, experience has shown that ensuring the large-scale practical implementation of research results via extension activities poses a greater challenge than mobilizing resources for needed research efforts. Unless this crucial step is taken, the farmers in the target areas of the SADC region will not be able to increase their yields and improve their living conditions. © 1994.},

After scrutinizing the failures and the pros and cons of GM crops in the region, the paper introduces some potentials for improving the malnutrition situation in SSA through launching a successful GM technology. However, it remains doubtful whether this technology can improve the situation of small-scale farmers as long as they receive no financial support from their national governments. Therefore, before any intervention, the socio-economic and environmental impacts of GM technology need to be carefully addressed in the framework of a series of risk assessment studies. Besides, some sort of multi-stakeholder dialog (from small-scale farmers to consumers) involving public-private sector and non-governmental organizations should be heated up at both national and regional levels with regard to the myths and truths of this technology. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Pesticide control is unrealistic for subsistence farmers. Furthermore, there are no cultural control methods or genetic sources of resistance. Biological control was a possibility, but the required ecological knowledge did not exist in the 1970s. A biological control programme could have been rapidly developed through sustained and coordinated funding using existing knowledge. Instead, it took 25 years to lay the scientific groundwork through occasional bursts of uncoordinated short-term activity using international scientists funded by large donors. There was little funding and few prominent roles for national scientists until 2000, when they were empowered by a different approach taken by the McKnight Foundation. An operational system was quickly developed and deployed in which trained farmers rear and release the parasitoid Habrobracon hebetor to effectively eliminate the head miner. The national programme scientists demonstrated admirably that, when trusted and adequately supported and empowered, African researchers can deliver real and effective solutions that are scientifically sound, meet the needs of smallholder farmers, and contribute significantly to improved food security, community resilience and reduced poverty. © 2011 Earthscan.},

In this meta-analysis, the authors identify key discoveries on the potential of index-insurance in enhancing credit supply for smallholders and thus farm productivity. Design/methodology/approach – Following a systematic literature search in Scopus and Web of Science, relevant empirical articles were identified by using the following criteria search algorithm: “insurance” and (“weather” or “micro” or “area?based” or “rain*” or “livestock” or “index”), and ((“empiric*” or “experiment” or “trial” or “RCT” or “impact”) or (“credit” or “loan*” or “debt” or “finance”)). The authors identified 1,133 related papers, 110 of which were selected as closely matching the study criteria. After removing duplicates and analysing each document, 45 papers were included in the current analysis. The framework for addressing insurance and credit issues, in the paper, entails three subsequent themes, namely, adoption of insurance, impact of insurance and links between insurance and credit. Findings – It is not confirmed yet that demand for insurance is indeed hump-shaped in risk aversion and the functional form of this relationship should be tested in more detail. This also holds for the magnitude of the effect of trust and education on actual demand. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent other risk mitigation strategies form complements or substitutes to index-insurance. Lastly, the interaction between basis risk and price is important to the design of index-insurance products. If basis risk and price elasticity are indeed highly correlated, products that diminish basis risk are crucial in increasing demand. On the impact of bundled products, e.g. combination of insurance and credit, limited empirical research has been conducted. For example, it is unknown to what extent credit suppliers would react to the insured status of farmers or what the preferences of farmers are when it comes to a mix of financial products. In addition, several researchers have suggested that microfinance institutions or banks could insure themselves against covariate risk, yet no empirical evidence about this insurance mechanism has been conducted so far. Research limitations/implications – The authors based the research on scientific literature uploaded in Scopus and Web of Science. Other potentially insightful grey literature was not included due to lack of accessibility. Given the research findings, there is plenty of opportunity for further research particularly with regard to the effects of bundled products, e.g. insurance plus credit, on demand for index-insurance, supply of credit, loan conditions and impact on farm productivity and farmers’ well-being. Practical implications – Microfinance institutions, insurance companies, NGOs, research institutions and universities, particularly in developing countries, will be interested to learn about the systematic review of scientific research done in the area of insurance and credit for agriculture and the possibilities for application in their own practice of supplying these financial products. Social implications – A rigorous understanding of the potential of index-insurance and credit is essential for identifying the right mix of financial products that help smallholder farmers to increase farm productivity and their own well-being. Originality/value – The paper is valuable due to its rigorous evaluation of existing theoretical and empirical research around issues explaining the degree of adoption and impact of index-insurance and that of bundled financial products (i.e. index-insurance plus credit). The paper has the potential to become essential reading for academics, practitioners and policy-makers interested in researching and putting in practice the best options leading to greater farm productivity and well-being in developing countries. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Parasitic weeds such as Striga spp and Rhamphicarpa fistulosa in smallholder rice production systems form an increasing problem for food and income security in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper we implement the Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS) as a diagnostic tool to identify specific and generic entry points for innovations to address parasitic weeds in rain-fed rice production in Tanzania. Data were gathered across three study sites in Tanzania where parasitic weeds are eminent (Kyela, Songea Rural and Morogoro Rural districts). The results demonstrate that in Tanzania, weeds in general and parasitic weeds in particular receive little attention in agricultural research, training and education curricula. Crop protection policies mainly focus on the control of (insect) pest and diseases and there is relatively little attention for weed prevention, which is essential for addressing parasitic weed problems effectively. Specific entry points for innovation include increasing awareness of parasitic weed problems among farmers, extension and crop protection officers and policymakers. In regions where awareness is relatively high, participatory research approaches can provide a basis for developing locally adapted parasitic weed management strategies. Generic entry points for innovation include enhanced collaboration and interaction between stakeholders across different levels, for example in multi-stakeholder platforms. This can provide the basis for developing and implementing coherent policy and development strategies to address structural constraints in the agricultural system, including the promotion of clean local seed systems, investments in physical and knowledge infrastructure development, adequate backstopping of agricultural extension officers, agribusiness training for farmers, quality control of agricultural inputs, timely access to agricultural inputs, and improved access to markets for farmers. Together the specific and generic entry points can strengthen the innovation capacity of Tanzania's agricultural system to address parasitic weed problems, as well as other complex agricultural problems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Resources for crop production are often scarce in smallholder farming systems in the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Decisions on the allocation of such resources are often made at farm rather than at field plot scale. To handle the uncertainty caused by both lack of data and imperfect knowledge inherent to these agricultural systems, we developed a dynamic summary model of the soil-crop system that captures essential interactions determining the short- and long-term crop productivity, while keeping a degree of simplicity that allows its parameterisation, use and dissemination in the tropics. Generic, summary functions describing crop productivity may suffice for addressing questions concerning trade-offs on resource allocation at farm scale. Such functions can be derived from empirical (historical) data or, when they involve potential or water-limited crop yields, can be generated using process-based, detailed crop simulation models. This paper describes the approach to simulating crop productivity implemented in the model FIELD (Field-scale Interactions, use Efficiencies and Long-Term soil fertility Development), based on the availability of light, water, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and the interactions between these factors. We describe how these interactions are simulated and use examples from case studies in African farming systems to illustrate the use of detailed crop models to generate summary functions and the ability of FIELD to capture long-term trends in soil C and crop yields, crop responses to applied nutrients across heterogeneous smallholder farms and the implications of overlooking the effects of intra-seasonal rainfall variability in the model. An example is presented that evaluates the sensitivity of the model to resource allocation decisions when operating (linked to livestock and household models) at farm scale. Further, we discuss the assessment of model performance, going beyond the calculation of simple statistics to compare simulated and observed results to include broader criteria such as model applicability. In data-scarce environments such as SSA, uncertainty in parameter values constrains the performance of detailed process-based models, often forcing model users to 'guess' (or set to default values) parameters that are seldom measured in practice. The choice of model depends on its suitability and appropriateness to analyse the relevant scale for the question addressed. Simpler yet dynamic models of the various subsystems (crop, soil, livestock, manure) may prove more robust than detailed, process-based models when analysing farm scale questions on system design and resource allocation in SSA. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examined technical efficiency (TE) of farmer teachers in the uptake and dissemination of a 'push-pull' technology (PPT) for control of Striga weed and stemborers in Western Kenya. A total sample of 112 farmer teachers (FTs) and 560 follower farmers (FFs) who had adopted the PPT were randomly selected and interviewed between July and August 2007. The farm production constraints significantly reduced with an overall 53\% margin following PPT uptake. Overall, there were considerable benefits from training resulting in significant differences in understanding and applying of PPT. The farmers' extension strategy had a significant multiplier effect in increasing PPT uptake. The average TE by FTs was 78\% while FFs had 71\% suggesting room for improvement. The TE was influenced by farmers' interactions with neighbouring farmers, memberships in local groups, type of farmer, farmer's age, marital status and farmer's level of education. The efficiency can be improved by providing farmers with incentives and training, increasing field demonstrations, providing Desmodium seed and credit for other needed inputs to accelerate PPT transfer. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper assesses farmer adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and innovation after being exposed to Farms of the Future Approach (FotF). First; we explore and assess the various CSA technologies and practices; including institutional innovations farmers are adopting. Second; we identify and document farmer learning and dissemination pathways that can enhance adoption of CSA technologies and practices. Third; we identify existing institutions that enhance adoption of CSA practices. We use household survey data, complemented by qualitative information from focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The results show farmers are adopting a variety of CSA technologies, practices, and institutional innovations to after participating in the FotF approach with use of improved crop varieties, agroforestry, and scientific weather forecast information cited as the main practices. To minimize their risks and reduce vulnerabilities, farmers are diversifying and integrating five to 10 CSA practices in one season. Matengo pits, SACCOs, and efficient energy stoves were adopted by very few farmers due to their high initial investment costs and unsuitability to the area. Ninety-eight percent of farmers reported that they receive agricultural information orally from a variety of sources including government extension workers, seed companies, researchers, traditional experts, neighbors, radio agricultural shows, religious groups, farmer groups, and family members. Lastly, farmers reported that the FotF approach is a useful tool that enabled them to interact with other farmers and learn new CSA practices and innovations. Suggested improvements to make on the FotF included include longer trip duration, increased number of farmer participants, and gender balance and age considerations to include youth. © 2017 by the authors.},

In contrast, most previous theoretical literature on household agricultural decision making and land-use change in rural areas considers conditions of high population density and land scarcity, and is not, therefore, adequate for understanding critical land-use changes which may be occurring in frontier regions. This article first discusses the appropriateness and inadequacies of the analytical frameworks commonly used to explain the expansion of settler agriculture into remote forest regions and the unsustainable land-use practices observed in these areas. This review serves as the basis for characterizing resource allocation under the particular conditions of frontier environments. A conceptual advance in the analysis is its consideration of the way institutional/policy factors and farm-level characteristics can interact to produce land-use outcomes. This knowledge is essential to understand not only the social and economic factors affecting present land use and choice of technology, but also those factors influencing farmers' demand for more optimal systems of land use which are consistent with varying agro-ecological potentials, demographic situations, and their own management capacity. © 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

An efficient endogenous switching regression model (ESRM) was used to estimate the impact of climate change adaptation strategy on the net income of rice farmers. The MVP results show that the socio-economic factors, the institutional factors, and locational variables of some households statistically influenced the choice of climate change adaptation strategies employed. Complementarities among all the adaptation strategies used by the farmers were revealed by the positive pair-wise correlation matrix of the MVP model. The study also indicated that farmers affected by prolonged drought and incidences of flood were more likely to adopt adaptation strategies on their farmlands. The ESRM treatment effect indicated that the average net income per rice farm of those who adopted the strategies was significantly higher than that of those who did not. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations related to agricultural extension systems and climate change education through information and communication technologies.

We start from the idea that the promotion of community-based biofuel production and use requires taking interactions between social-cultural, biophysical, economic, political and legal subsystems across different scales and levels of analysis through time into account. Our analysis demonstrates that heterogeneous farming strategies and their synergies at community level should be carefully assessed. Furthermore, national and international political and legal developments, such as the development of biofuel sustainability criteria, influence the local space in which community-based biofuel developments take place. We conclude that ex-ante integrated assessment and creating an enabling environment can enhance space for sustainable community-based biofuel production and use.

	abstract = {Over the course of just a few years, shrimp farming has become a major aquaculture production system in coastal areas of several developing countries across the globe. However, farmers are facing a variety of risks related to disease, market, and climate, which influence risk management strategies and adoption of new technologies. This paper looks at three practices related to pond management: (1) water quality management to ensure a good environment for shrimp growth; (2) adequate feed input; and (3) disease control practices in order to mitigate the risk of disease outbreak in the pond. We investigated adoption of these three practices in smallholder shrimp farms in the Mekong Delta, by exploring how and whether membership into a producer's cluster influences access to knowledge and perception of risk in the adoption process. The results show that, after controlling for farm characteristics, farm clustering has a positive relationship with the adoption of water quality management, feed inputs, and disease control practices. Results also indicate that increasing interaction frequency with public sector and private sector's actors, as well as the perceived degree of market risk, positively influences the adoption of the three pond management practices under study. Mediation analyses show that being a member of a farmer cluster influences adoption of farming practices via two underlying processes: frequency of interaction with public and private sector's actors, and perception of market risk, both of which ultimately promote the adoption of practices. We conclude that clustering is a promising avenue for fostering interactions between farmers and key supporting actors in aquaculture, and impacts both the formation of specific aqua-related risk perceptions and subsequent practice adoption. As such, clusters – by fostering linkages and facilitating interactions between different knowledge sources – can promote adoption of practices toward sustainable intensification. However, to more effectively deploy a cluster approach a key policy and practice implication is to take into consideration local idiosyncrasies defined by their social interactions, risk perception and spatial dimensions in order to better facilitate local linkages between farms (horizontal coordination) and a better integration with the value chain (vertical coordination). © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Manure has been used as a fertilizer since ancient times and if well-managed it can be an asset, promoting sustainable agriculture, and increasing crop production, particularly for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, most farmers in SSA do not apply recommended manure management practices, such as roofing animal housing, having a water-proof floor or covering manure during storage, causing large nutrient losses during manure storage, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing the quality of the manure as a fertilizer. This paper compares manure management practices in representative SSA countries, and summarizes government policies and socio-cultural practices that influence the adoption of good (recommended) manure management practices. Three steps were applied in this analysis: (i) review of manure management practices from various literature sources, (ii) interviews on manure management practices and policies with key stakeholders from 13 SSA countries, and (iii) surveys of manure management practices on small, medium, and large scale farms in Ethiopia and Malawi. The review confirms the potential of manure to improve crop yields and promote sustainable agriculture in SSA. Unfortunately, most SSA countries (a) do not explicitly mention manure management in their policies (b) have different ministries that share responsibilities on manure management, often leading to incoherent policies and abnegation of these responsibilities (c) take limited action to promote good practices or enforce legislation on manure management. Also, the field survey indicated that farmers lack knowledge on manure management. However, farmers are able to access agricultural extension services from both government and non-government agencies, although these extension services rarely included information on improved manure management practices. Extension services that encourage exchange and interaction between farmers were most successful in increasing adoption of good manure management practices, and are recommended. In addition, efforts to improve manure management in SSA should strengthen the enforcement of existing policies and provide an enabling environment for adoption of good manure management practices. © Copyright © 2019 Ndambi, Pelster, Owino, de Buisonjé and Vellinga.},

However, there is still much to learn about the various connections and interactions associated with reactions to what are often referred to as "land grabs", and the ways they are associated or not associated with broader social movements and networks opposed to land grabbing. There is also the need to develop language for discussing these circumstances, something I aim to contribute to in this article. Here, I present four different cases of types of resistance, or what I refer to as contingent contestations, to land concessions in southern Laos and northeastern Cambodia (two from each country), focusing on the perspectives and associated strategies of smallholder farmers, but without ignoring broader issues. I consider the roles of locals in these contestations, through emphasizing the importance of histories, identities/ethnicities, politics, and geography in determining the types of responses to these land deals that emerge, and the strategies that are adopted for contesting these developments. © 2017 by the author.},

	abstract = {Smallholder irrigation expansion would significantly increase agricultural production, and reduce food insecurity and poverty levels in East Africa. This paper reviews literature on trends, constraints and opportunities of smallholder irrigation in four East African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Irrigation development has been slow in these countries, and has been mainly through traditional schemes. Recently, individual irrigation technologies such as small motorized pumps, drip kits, treadle pumps, rope and washer pumps are being promoted. Adoption of these technologies and expansion of smallholder irrigation however face a number of challenges including land tenure issues; lack of access to appropriate irrigation technologies, improved agricultural inputs, reliable markets, finance and credit services, and research support; poor transport and communication infrastructures; poor irrigation water management; poor extension systems; and the over dependence on national governments, NGOs and donors for support. Despite these challenges, opportunities exist for smallholder irrigation expansion in East Africa. Such opportunities include: high untapped irrigation potential; rainwater harvesting to improve water availability; high commitment of national governments, NGOs and donors to smallholder irrigation expansion; low cost irrigation technologies adaptable to local conditions; traditional schemes rehabilitation; growing urbanization; and increased use of mobile phones that can be used to disseminate information. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

However, adoption of the set of complementary technologies that are required in ISFM is quite variable and studies tend to focus on single technologies. In this study we used cluster analysis to group technologies and ordered probit to determine the probability of multiple technology adoption. The result show that usage of ISFM in the Chinyanja Triangle (Southern Africa) is grouped into 3 technological sets based on complementarities. The set of nutrient dense technologies of inorganic fertiliser, compost and animal manure (ISFMset3) indicates that they are used by farmers who face similar opportunities of having land that require minimal input, sell produce at farm gate as opposed to market, have more transport and communication facilities, and recover from livestock loss. Loss of crops, however, deter adoption of this set. The technological set comprising of fallow, rotation and grain legumes (ISFMset2) which enhances biomass accumulation and nitrogen fixation with complementary effects in cereal dominated farming system, is more likely adopted by households with land that require more inputs, are more educated, own more bicycles and have higher financial capital. Other four technologies (ISFMset1 including mulch, lime, compost and agroforestry) are used by a few individuals to address specific constraints in nutrient and water retention, and acidity. The result also indicated variations in usage of ISFMset3 between sites. These results are instrumental in identifying factors that influence adoption of a set of ISFM technologies in the Chinyanja Triangle and could be of use in targeting research and development initiatives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The analysis focuses on how structural conditions (infrastructure, institutions, interaction and collaboration and capabilities and resources) enable or constrain interactions between niche-level Jatropha experiments and incumbent energy, agriculture and rural development regimes in Mozambique. Investors in agro-industrial Jatropha projects focused on establishing projects in areas with relatively good infrastructure, rather than in remote rural areas. Furthermore, they predominantly focused on Jatropha production instead of investing in the entire Jatropha value chain, which turned out to be a challenge in itself, as growing a productive Jatropha crop was much more complex than initially anticipated. The development of institutions that could nurture and protect Jatropha projects from the prevailing regimes lagged behind Jatropha project establishment, leading to an insecure investment climate. Strong inter-ministerial collaboration and organized civil society interaction and representation contrasted with non-organized private sector and rather isolated smallholder Jatropha projects. The global financial crisis and limited adaptive capacity reduced the time and space for experimentation and learning to overcome disappointing crop performance. Together, this hampered Jatropha's potential to challenge the energy, agricultural and rural development regimes. Nevertheless, the Jatropha experience did initiate the development of policy and regulation and stimulated interaction and collaboration between specific groups of stakeholders, which could provide the basis to capture future biofuel momentum in Mozambique. © 2014 by the authors.},

Villagers from two communities in the Tunari Mountain Range were asked to list, describe, map and categorize the places they knew on their community's territory. Results show that place names capture spatially explicit units which integrate biotic and abiotic nature and humans, and that there is an emphasis on topographic terms, highlighting the importance of geodiversity. Farmers' perspectives differ from the classical view of ecosystems because they 'humanize' places, considering them as living beings with agency. Consequently, they do not make a distinction between natural and cultural heritage. Their perspective of the environment is that of a personalized, dynamic relationship with the elements of the natural world that are perceived as living entities. A practical implication of the findings for sustainable development is that since places names make the links between people and the elements of the landscape, toponymy is a tool for ecosystem management rooted in indigenous knowledge. Because place names refer to holistic units linked with people's experience and spatially explicit, they can be used as an entry point to implement an intercultural dialogue for more sustainable land management. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The project explored the livelihood strategies of coffee growers in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica facing multiple stressors of economic (market shocks and price volatility) and physical nature (climate variability and pest incidence). Our objective was to determine the factors that influence farmers' decisions and the implications of those decisions for the people and the landscapes of the region. To achieve this objective, we intended to engage farm communities and sector representatives in the research process, and to a large extent this intent was realized. Nevertheless, the project illustrates the difficulties in achieving knowledge "co-production" with stakeholders whose day-to-day existence focuses on issues largely outside the domain of the research program. We adopted decision-analysis tools to integrate our knowledge and hypotheses to find a common language and structure for our research design. In relation to regional and national policy makers and sector experts, we aimed to communicate the decision-environment of the smallholder producer to enhance awareness of the institutional opportunities and constraints in the adaptation process. For the farmers themselves, we aimed to serve as conduits and mirrors of their own knowledge, rather than serving as external authorities on issues that appeared to be of little interest to them. Through the course of the project, we experimented with diverse modes of stakeholder interaction and, through collaboration with local experts in communication strategies, identified a set of tools for successful dissemination of results. The credibility and direct ties of the participating research organizations and collaborating institutes with the local communities were often an asset, sometimes a complication, but always a critical factor in the process of stakeholder interaction. The messages constructed from the collective knowledge of local farmers in distinct regions in four countries with different social and institutional histories represent crucial information for policy makers who are looking to support the adaptation processes of rural people facing changes of a global nature. However, communicating these messages in a usable and useful way to decision makers at various levels proved to be challenging. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The goal of this research was to assess the extent to which farmers have incorporated their observations of native species and ecological processes into farm management practices in a hillside agroforestry system of western Honduras. The system incorporates slash-and-mulch of native vegetation (rather than slash-and-burn cultivation, which was widely practiced in the area before 1990), and the retention of trees within cropping fields. Information on farmer knowledge was elicited primarily through semi-structured interviews with 20 farmers. Farmers interviewed distinguish several local soil types on the basis of soil texture, colour, structure and stone content, with each soil type having varying suitability for the major crops grown in the district (maize, beans, sorghum and pasture). The most highly valued tree species are those that fulfil multiple economic and agricultural functions, including having a positive influence on soil quality through decomposition, nutrient cycling, and provision of soil cover. In particular, species with small, fine leaves that gave dappled shade (rather than solid shade) and decomposed rapidly were preferred. Farmers named 16 commonly recognised, distinct soil macrofauna taxa. The most detailed knowledge on the relationship between soil fauna and soil quality was held on taxa considered to have either beneficial or harmful effects on farming activities, such as earthworms and beetle larvae. Farmers had complex understanding of the influence of fire on soils, vegetation, crop yield and soil biota over various lengths of time, which may have been gained through a combination of first-hand experience, interaction with agricultural extension workers, and information gained from other farmers. It is likely that local ecological knowledge of the effect of different species on soil quality, the interactions among species, and the role of vegetation in maintaining agricultural productivity and landscape integrity, is an important component of the adoption and success of the agroforestry system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Research efforts to improve farm productivity increasingly focus on resource interactions and trade-offs operating at farm-scale. Farm-scale models that integrate summary models of the various subsystems (crops, livestock, household) are proposed to analyse the complexity of management systems. NUANCES-FIELD is a summary model of the crop/soil system that calculates seasonal crop production based on resource availability, capture and utilization efficiencies. A detailed mechanistic crop growth model, APSIM, was used to generate parameters and variables that can be introduced as descriptive functions in NUANCES-FIELD. To such end, we first parameterized and tested APSIM based on several field experiments carried out on different soil types in western Kenya farms where nitrogen and/or phosphorus were applied. The model was further configured to generate nitrogen and phosphorus response curves as a function of soil condition (carbon content, clay content, phosphorus-sorption characteristics) and the effects of alternative weed management scenarios in relation to labour availability. Nitrogen, phosphorus and rainfall capture efficiencies ranged between 0.22-0.85 kg kg-1, 0.05-0.29 kg kg-1 and 0.10-0.53 mm mm-1, respectively, depending on soil nutrient and physical conditions. Variation in the integrated seasonal fraction of radiation intercepted (intFRINT) with plant density was adequately described by the function y = 0.058x + 0.11 within a range of 1.5-5.5 maize plants per m2. Investigation of weed management using the APSIM model identified a weed-free period of at least five weeks from maize emergence for minimum yield loss from weed-crop competition. The simulation exercises confirmed that resource-use efficiencies sharply decrease on moving from relatively fertile fields 'close' to the homestead towards degraded 'remote' fields within the same farm, giving impetus to expedite the search for better targeted management strategies for spatially-heterogeneous farms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis begins with a summary of the historical development of the technology of rubber cultivation, focusing on the transplanting of Para rubber from South America to South-East Asia and the construction of knowledge of rubber cultivation both during and following this transplanting. This history of knowledge construction was characterised by two critical discontinuities, involving the separation of the rubber plant from its original conceptual context, and extensive experimentation with rubber production technologies. The resulting system of Asian smallholder cultivation is, like many other such systems, neither indigenous nor exogenous but rather hybrid in character, and representation of this hybridity is strongly contested by the principal parties involved, namely the smallholders on the one hand and on the other the government estate sector. It is concluded, first that the concept of indigenous knowledge is a type of "dividing practice", which over-writes a history of interaction and contestation and, second, that the concept of indigenous knowledge has gone through a "life cycle" of initial reception and utility followed by subsequent rejection and disutility.},

	abstract = {Resilience is often considered a precondition for sustainable social-ecological systems. But how can this understanding of resilience be applied to food systems? We operationalized the concept by subdividing it into different resilience dimensions, namely: buffer capacity, self-organization, and capacity for learning and adaptation. Specific indicators were defined for each dimension: (1) agrobiodiversity and livelihood assets for buffer capacity; (2) decentralization and independence, local consumption of production, interest groups, ecological self-regulation, and connectivity for self-organization; and (3) knowledge of threats and opportunities, reflective and shared learning, feedback mechanisms, existence and use of local-traditional knowledge, and a shared food system vision for capacity for learning and adaptation. Next, we applied the resilience indicators to different food systems (agroindustrial, local, and agroecological) in Kenya and Bolivia, including assessment of the interaction and coexistence of food systems. While the contexts in the two countries differ greatly, we identified several common trends that appear to be undermining food system resilience in both settings. These trends include low ecological buffer capacity and self-regulation in agroindustrial food systems; strong disparities in income and access to productive resources; competition for water, land, and labor; exclusion from markets; and low human capital and feedback mechanisms in locally based, traditional food systems. Taken together, these trends cast doubt on food system coexistence narratives.

To explore the influence factors of the adoption of green control techniques (GCTs) by family farms, this study focused on sample selection problems, namely, understanding (or not) and willingness (or not), using bivariate probit and regression linear models based on a field survey data from 676 family farms in Huang-huai-hai Plain. Estimation results showed that: 1) the frequency of neighbor communication, the strengths of the extension of agricultural technique sector and media publicity, education, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant positive influences on information collection individually; however, the gender of farmers had a significant negative influence. 2) The perceived ease of use and usefulness about the technique, the number of laborers, the strength of the extension of agricultural technique sector, education, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant positive influences on adoption willingness. 3) Finally, the perceived ease of use and usefulness about the technique, fund status, the strengths of media publicity and the extension of agricultural technique sector, and education of farmers had significant positive influences on adoption intensity; whereas the frequency of neighbor communion, gender, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant negative influences on adoption intensity. Thus, to develop the GCTs successfully, the Chinese government should improve the effects of technique training, ameliorate financing environment, focus on publicity and guidance, establish and improve the system of education and training for family farmers, and strengthen the team concerning the extended construction of grassroots technique. © 2017},

Even in very poor communities, radio penetration is vast; it is estimated there are over 800 million radios in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper summarizes evidence on food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa and strategies to provide information on innovative agricultural practices to smallholder farmers. The research in this paper is then discussed within the context of research on information and communication technologies (ICTS) for development. Next, the paper presents the ICT-enhanced participatory radio campaign approach and ICT innovations introduced by Farm Radio International, a Canadian nongovernmental organization. The paper analyzes two participatory radio campaigns that use both listening groups and ICTs to engage African farmers. Research on these radio campaigns in six African countries is reported to examine how the participatory approach impacted listenership, knowledge and initial adoption of agricultural techniques and practices presented in the radio campaigns. The authors conclude that the findings of research on these projects could be highly relevant for increasing awareness and adoption of agricultural practices in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Four hundred and seventy one pig farms slaughtering finisher pigs at government operated abattoirs participated in this study. The objectives of this study were to group: (a) smallholder (S) and commercial (C) production systems into patterns according to their herd health providers (HHPs), and obtain descriptive information about the grouped S and C production systems; and (b) identify key HHPs within each production system using social network analysis. On-farm veterinarians, private consultants, pharmaceutical company representatives, government veterinarians, livestock and agricultural technicians, and agricultural supply stores were found to be actively interacting with pig farmers. Four clusters were identified based on production system and their choice of HHPs. Differences in management and biosecurity practices were found between S and C clusters. Private HHPs provided a service to larger C and some larger S farms, and have little or no interaction with the other HHPs. Government HHPs provided herd health service mainly to S farms and small C farms. Agricultural supply stores were identified as a dominant solitary HHP and provided herd health services to the majority of farmers. Increased knowledge of the routine management and biosecurity practices of S and C farmers and the key HHPs that are likely to be associated with those practices would be of value as this information could be used to inform a risk-based approach to disease surveillance and control. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Participatory Plant Breeding (PPB) is mostly considered relevant to smallholder agriculture in developing countries. PPB involves getting farmers to participate in plant breeding to overcome shortcomings in the formal plant breeding system. The potato breeding system in the Netherlands has a long standing tradition of farmer participation in breeding. This PPB differs from the 'standard' PPB model as there is substantial private sector involvement and the system is situated in a modern, western context. Since its inception, farmer-breeders have contributed substantially to developing this potato breeding system, which supplies a large diversity of crop varieties that are grown in very varied environmental conditions around the world and for different consumer markets. This paper describes the current organizational structure and practices, provides some historical background and analyses the functions, relations and interactions of the major actors in the system. It argues that a historically international and commercially orientated potato sector was able to prosper because of a supportive political and legal context, which provided public institutional support to private sector potato breeding activities. Farmers' knowledge and skills are particularly well expressed and vital in breeding in potato-a very heterogeneous and vegetatively-propagated crop. A new PPB initiative called BioImpuls recently emerged and engages organic potato farmers in a search to develop late blight-resistant varieties for the organic sector. This supports the argument that farmers' knowledge can substantially contribute to modern and diversified breeding. While Dutch potato breeding is a special case in various respects, our analysis identifies several key attributes which could inform the design of successful PPB programmes in developing countries. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.},

	abstract = {Innovation in agronomy by large numbers of smallholder farmers will need to accelerate if global commitments to end hunger are to be achieved in the face of major climate and other global change that are both caused by, and impact, agriculture. Conventional research and development in agronomy have involved a research process that produces technologies, which are then promoted for uptake by large numbers of farmers through extension, with both research and extension phases being more or less participatory. Recent research, including key contributions to this special issue, reveals that the performance of many technology options varies hugely across the geographies over which development programmes operate, depending on social, economic and ecological context. This severely limits the value of attempting to produce recommendations for large areas and numbers of farmers and identifies the need for new ways of supporting innovation that address the real-world heterogeneity of farmer circumstances. Addressing this widespread phenomenon of option by context interaction (OxC) has profound implications for how agronomic research and development are organised. Papers in this special issue show the nature and implications of such interactions and suggest ways in which research and development systems need to respond in order to support locally relevant innovation. It is evident that a paradigm shift is well underway, with researchers embracing new modes of thinking and action required to address OxC interactions, but these also need to be taken up and further developed by extension and change agents in the public and private sector. It is only through continued co-development of methods involving both these constituencies, working closely with farmers that sufficient progress is likely to be made for smallholder farming to keep pace with global demand for food without further damaging the environmental resources upon which production is based. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {When anthropologists interviewed Honduran and Nepali smallholders in the mid-1990s, they were told that “Insects are a terrible mistake in God’s creation” and “There’s nothing that kills them, except for insecticides”. Even growers who maintained a close bond with nature were either entirely unaware of natural pest control, or expressed doubt about the actual value of these services on their farm. Farmers’ knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards pests and natural enemies are of paramount importance to the practice of biological control, but are all too often disregarded. In this study, we conduct a retrospective analysis of the extent to which social science facets have been incorporated into biological control research over the past 25 years. Next, we critically examine various biological control forms, concepts and technologies using a ‘diffusion of innovations’ framework, and identify elements that hamper their diffusion and farm-level uptake. Lastly, we introduce effective observation-based learning strategies, such as farmer field schools to promote biological control, and list how those participatory approaches can be further enriched with information and communication technologies (ICT). Although biological control scientists have made substantial technological progress and generate nearly 1000 papers annually, only a fraction (1.4\%) of those address social science or technology transfer aspects. To ease obstacles to enhanced farmer learning about biological control, we describe ways to communicate biological control concepts and technologies for four divergent agricultural knowledge systems (as identified within a matrix built around ‘cultural importance’ and ‘ease of observation’). Furthermore, we describe how biological control innovations suffer a number of notable shortcomings that hamper their farm-level adoption and subsequent diffusion, and point at ways to remediate those by tactical communication campaigns or customized, (ICT-based) adult education programs. Amongst others, we outline how video, smart phones, or tablets can be used to convey key ecological concepts and biocontrol technologies, and facilitate social learning. In today’s digital era, cross-disciplinary science and deliberate multi-stakeholder engagement will provide biocontrol advocates the necessary means to bolster farmer adoption rates, counter-act surging insecticide use, and restore public trust in one of nature’s prime services. © 2017, International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).},

	abstract = {The negative effects of climate change on cocoa production are often enhanced through agricultural intensification, while research institutions and enterprises try to minimize yield gaps with production strategies mitigating climate risk. Ecological intensification is such a production strategy, whereby yield increase is promoted through reduced agrochemical inputs and increased regulating ecosystem services such as pollination. However, we still know little about cocoa pollination ecology and services, although they appear to be key to understand yield functions. Here, we provide an extensive literature review on cocoa pollination focusing on three main aspects: non-plant (external) and plant regulated (internal) factors affecting pollination, pollinator agents, and ecological intensification management for enhancing pollination success and yield. Pollination services by many arthropod groups such as ants, bees, and parasitic wasps, and not only ceratopogonids, may be a way to increase cocoa productivity and secure smallholders income, but their role is unknown. Several environmental and socioeconomic factors can blur potential pollination benefits. Current knowledge gaps preclude our understanding of how to (i) identify the major pollinator species, (ii) disentangle the direct or indirect role of ants in pollination, (iii) design effective habitat improvements for pollination (by litter and shade management), and (iv) quantify the yield gaps due to pollination limitation. Optimizing cocoa pollination alone appears to be a powerful ecological tool to increase the yield of smallholders, but experimental research is required to validate these results in a realistic setting. In general, industry, governments and smallholders need to develop more joined efforts to ecological production strategies. In particular, farm-base management innovations based on robust scientific evidence must be designed to meet the increasing demand for chocolate and to mitigate cocoa yield gaps. This review suggests that diversified systems and associated ecosystem services, such as pollination, can help to achieve such goals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, we review the conditions that have been undermining sustainable food and nutrition security in the Caribbean, focusing on issues of history, economy, and innovation. Building on this discussion, we then argue for a different approach to agricultural development in the Small Island Developing States of the CARICOM that draws primarily on socioecological resilience and agricultural innovation systems frameworks. Research needs are subsequently identified, including the need to better understand how social capital can facilitate adaptive capacity in diverse smallholder farming contexts; how formal and informal institutions interact in domestic agriculture and food systems to affect collaboration, co-learning, and collective action; how social actors might better play bridging and linking roles that can support mutual learning, collaboration, and reciprocal knowledge flows; and the reasons underlying past innovation failures and successes to facilitate organizational learning. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Factor analysis of survey data from 44 smallholders identified three factors—related to farm size, farmer’s engagement, and household structure—that explained 70 \% of cumulative variance. The subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis yielded three clusters. Cluster 1 included the most senior farmers with fewest years of education but greatest years of experience. Cluster 2 included farmers who reported access to extension, cooperative services, and more management changes. Cluster 2 obtained 25 and 35 \% more milk than farmers in clusters 1 and 3, respectively. Cluster 3 included the youngest farmers, with most years of education and greatest availability of family labor. Access to a network and membership in a community of peers appeared as important contributors to success. Smallholders gravitated towards easy to implement technologies that have immediate benefits. Nonusers of high investment technologies found them unaffordable because of cost, insufficient farm size, and lack of knowledge or reliable electricity. Multivariate analysis may be a useful tool in planning extension activities and organizing channels of communication to effectively target farmers with varying needs, constraints, and motivations for change and in identifying farmers who may exemplify models of change for others who manage farms that are structurally similar but performing at a lower level. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Model use is illustrated in this paper by simulating the impact of rice seed policy on the livelihood of representative smallholder farmers in Sierra Leone. Results show that the seed policy would improve farm productivity and boost household income but that it is not sufficient to fight poverty since 90\% of the surveyed farm households would continue to live below the extreme poverty line of 1 USD-equivalent per person per day. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Focusing specifically on the role and experiences of extension advisers, it draws evidence from an evaluation of the 'Options for Farm Families Programme'. It is argued that, while participatory approaches are increasingly promoted from an institutional perspective, they also raise a number of dilemmas for extension advisory staff that are ultimately damaging to the operation of such extension programmes if they remain outside the discursive framework within which the programme is shaped. Drawing on aspects of Habermas's theory of communicative action and Foucault's perspectives on the nature of power and power relations, this article attempts to provide a framework for understanding the apparent difficulties experienced by advisers in embracing participatory approaches in the case of the Options Programme and their tacit adoption of what might be described as adaptive strategies that have effectively seen the participatory element of the programme circumvented. It is contended that, while participatory approaches open up important new dimensions in extension practices, they can only be successfully applied when cognisance is taken of the full context in which advisers currently operate and when the advisers' own conceptualisation of extension is clearly established. © 2010 The Authors.

A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data. SPSS and STATA were used for descriptive and quantitative analysis.Radio, television and the mobile phone were found to be the most accessible ICTs and were often used to access information on production or/and marketing of bananas. The least accessible ICTs were computers, internet services and video cassettes. Socio-economic factors like age, gender, income and acreage of bananas planted had an influence on the intensity of use of ICT tools as a source of agricultural information by smallholder banana farmers. Use of ICTs was found to influence adoption of tissue culture (TC) bananas. Low levels of education and distance to internet services were found to be the most constraining to the use of ICT tools. Other constraints included: lack of money to buy internet services, digital cameras and computers. Farmers were of the opinion that radio and the mobile phone were the most useful ICT tools while television, print media, internet/email and video cassettes/DVDs were the least useful as a source of information on banana production.This study elucidates the important role of ICTs in disseminating agricultural information. There is need for the government to demystify ICT training at all levels of education to improve local content development. Reduction of taxes on radio-wave licensing and improving accessibility to affordable and quality handsets will aid in intensifying the use of radio and mobile phones by farmers in acquiring information. © 2013 Wageningen University.},

To maintain crop production, farmers used inorganic fertilizers and a variety of locally-derived fertilizers: manure, termitarium soil, crop residues, woodland litter, compost and household waste. On average, locally-derived fertilizers provide about 25 kg N ha−1 yr−1 and 65 kg N ha−1 yr−1 for fields and gardens, respectively, indicating the importance of gardens as a focus for soil management. Farmers achieve target yields without the high application rates recommended by the extension service, provably because of the positive interactive effects of applying inorganic and organic fertilizer. Current yields on these nutrient-poor sands cannot be maintained in the absence of the inorganic inputs, thus sustainability is threatened by rising human populations and the recent massive increase in fertilizer prices. © 1998 Taylor \&amp; Francis Group, LLC.},

Adoption of climate change adaptation strategies that increase agricultural productivity and at the same time building farmers’ resilience capacity has become a top policy priority in SSA. In this study, we investigate how maize-dependent smallholders in Ethiopia adapt to climate change. Both household and plot-level data were collected, and subsequently analysed by a multivariate probit regression model. Results show that most climate change adaptation strategies implemented by maize-dependent smallholders, are complementary. Combining conservation tillage, mixed maize-legume cropping and terracing along with the use of drought-resistant maize varieties allows farmers to increase productivity while building resilience to climate change more than a subset of these strategies. Findings indicate that the likelihood of adopting soil and water conservation practices, drought-resistant maize varieties and chemical fertilizers significantly increase among young and male-headed households as well as farmers having confidence in extension agents and membership in local organisations. Hence, policies should aim at further building agricultural extension agents’ capacity by providing effective and continuous education and training on climate change impacts and responses. Promoting family ties and household memberships in local organisations through facilitating mutual cooperation and communication among farming communities would help to foster adoption of climate change adaptation strategies. © 2018},

	abstract = {Pig production in peri-urban smallholder value chains in Uganda is severely constrained by impact of disease, particularly African swine fever (ASF), and the economic consequences of an inefficient pig value chain. Interventions in the form of biosecurity to control ASF disease outbreaks and pig business hub models to better link smallholder farmers to pig markets have the potential to address the constraints. However, there is a dearth of evidence of the effects of the interventions on performance and distribution of outcomes along the pig value chain. An ex-ante impact assessment utilising System Dynamics model was used to assess the impact of the interventions in peri-urban pig value chains in Masaka district. The results showed that although implementation of biosecurity interventions results in reduction of ASF outbreaks, it also leads to a 6.3\% reduction in farmer profit margins per year but more than 7\% increase in other value chain actors’ margins. The pig business hub intervention alone results in positive margins for all value chain actors but minimal reduction in ASF outbreaks. When biosecurity and the pig business hub interventions are implemented together, the interaction effects of the interventions result in positive outcomes for both the control of ASF and improvement in farmers’ margins. Farmers may therefore be unwilling to adopt biosecurity practices if implemented alone to control ASF outbreaks unless there is a corresponding financial incentive to compensate for the high costs. This has implications for policy or developing institutions to facilitate cost sharing arrangement among chain actors and/or third party subsidy to provide incentives for producers to adopt biosecurity measures. © 2017 The Authors},

We combine qualitative and quantitative research methods with climate data analysis to gauge the climatic changes smallholders have perceived over the last 30 years, as well as how these changes have been experienced. At two research sites, each method produced markedly different results. Drawing on the work of feminist political ecologists and other geographers, we suggest that the dissonance between data sets generated using different research methods arises because each method produces knowledge that is partial and situated. To explain the contradictions between smallholder perceptions of climate change across the qualitative and quantitative methods and their disagreement with the climate record, we adopt aspects of assemblage theory and the dwelling perspective to suggest that smallholder knowledge of climate change is structured through their observations of and interactions with dynamic, networked socio-natural assemblages.We argue that a better understanding of the conduits through which perceptions and experiences of climate change come into being, and hence how climate knowledge is shaped, is necessary to account for the multiple epistemologies through which climate change is known. © 2015 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).},

However, the dissemination of WSI in China has been slow and little is understood with respect to why farmers adopt WSI or how WSI interacts with the social and institutional contexts in which it is embedded. By analyzing qualitative data from 37 semi-structured and 56 unstructured interviews across 13 villages in northwest China, this paper examines smallholder farmers’ knowledge and perceptions of WSI, and how WSI interacts with farmer livelihood decision-making and extant systems of land and water management. The results show that smallholders’ willingness to adopt and continuously use WSI was dampened by (1) a lack of communal capital and measures for conflict resolution, (2) a disconnect between the temporal demands of practicing WSI and the ways farmers prioritize different livelihood strategies, (3) misconceptions about WSI systems and how they work, (4) market risks, and (5) landownership structure and economies of scale. These results suggest that programs for promoting WSI must be holistic in nature and address smallholders’ day-to-day problems. Understanding why WSI did not succeed in some places will help formulate policy interventions that avoid reproducing conflicts, risks, and technological malfunctions responsible for previous failure. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {In subsistence farming systems of the developing world, adoption of resource-conserving practices such as integrated pest management (IPM) is often strikingly low. This has partially been ascribed to researchers' limited understanding of how technologies develop at the interface of the systems' social and ecological components. In Honduras (Central America), there exists concern about limited adoption and diffusion of IPM technologies in certain smallholder production systems. In this study, we determine social and ecological drivers of IPM adoption in subsistence maize production in the country's hillside environment. Honduran small-scale maize production is typified by a key insect pest (the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda) being partly kept at bay through action of a diverse natural enemy complex, including ants, social wasps, carabid beetles, and spiders. Local agricultural landscapes, primarily shaped through shifting cultivation, provide key resources to maintain this natural enemy diversity. These local ecological conditions and related natural enemy abundance strongly influence farmers' agroecological knowledge and pest management practices. In the meantime, farmer practices are also affected by local communication networks, which help validate and spread IPM concepts and technologies. Based on our findings, we advocate a holistic approach to improve IPM extension through mapping of agroecological opportunities, visualization of regional patterns in farmer knowledge, and associated priority setting. Local IPM capacity could be built through institutional strengthening and adaptive comanagement, while IPM training should be linked with natural resource management initiatives. These approaches may eventually improve the way IPM is delivered to small-scale farmers who operate in the ecologically diverse environments of the tropics. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

A sample of 350 farmers living in this region was selected through a multi-stage stratified and random sampling method. Principal component analysis revealed that three components play a role in the farmers’ decisions on adaptation methods, namely, farm production practices, farm financial management, and government programs and insurance. The relative influence of the factors listed under each of the three components was assessed using a multiple linear regression analysis. Our analysis showed that these factors accounted for 50\%, 25\%, and 40\% of the adaptation responses analyzed, respectively.

While scholars commonly assert that the foundation is part of a new breed of “philanthrocapitalists” who apply business principles to their philanthropic activities, little is known about what this really means or how the Gates Foundation works on the inside. This article seeks to deepen our understanding of this new development actor by examining its organizational culture. I do this through a case study of the Gates Foundation's Agricultural Development program. Using in-depth interviews, materials from the BMGF's website, and a variety of other primary data sources, I explore the foundation's quotidian practices, workplace norms, and interactions with grantees as it tries to improve the lives of smallholder farmers in Africa. I argue that the Gates Foundation's heavy emphasis on strategic planning has produced an approach to agricultural development that abstracts away from smallholder farmers’ sociocultural worlds and relies on a generalizable set of development solutions. My analysis also reveals another significant consequence of the BMGF's organizational culture: By immersing bright, high-achieving professionals in the competitive, intense environment that characterizes the foundation, staff have learned to “manage up” (toward Bill) rather than manage down (toward their intended beneficiaries). This insulates and distances foundation staff from the field, making it difficult for them to listen to smallholder farmers, even though many express a genuine desire to do so. As a result, farmers continue to be treated as passive objects of development rather than as complex social actors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Transboundary animal diseases including foot-and-mouth disease and haemorrhagic septicaemia remain a major constraint for improving smallholder large ruminant productivity in the Mekong region, producing negative impacts on rural livelihoods and compromising efforts to reduce poverty and food insecurity. The traditional husbandry practices of smallholders largely exclude preventive health measures, increasing risks of disease transmission. Although significant efforts have been made to understand the social aspects of change development in agricultural production, attention to improving the adoption of biosecurity has been limited. This study reviews smallholder biosecurity risk factors identified in the peer-reviewed literature and from field research observations conducted in Cambodia and Laos during 2006-2013, considering these in the context of a change management perspective aimed at improving adoption of biosecurity measures. Motivation for change, resistance to change, knowledge management, cultural dimensions, systems theory and leadership are discussed. Due to geographical, physical and resource variability, the implementation of biosecurity interventions suitable for smallholders is not a 'one size fits all'. Smallholders should be educated in biosecurity principles and empowered to make personal decisions rather than adopt prescribed pre-defined interventions. Biosecurity interventions should be aligned with smallholder farmer motivations, preferably offering clear short-term risk management benefits that elicit interest from smallholders. Linking biosecurity and disease control with improved livestock productivity provides opportunities for sustainable improvements in livelihoods. Participatory research and extension that improves farmer knowledge and practices offers a pathway to elicit sustainable broad-scale social change. However, examples of successes need to be communicated both at the 'evidence-based level' to influence regional policy development and at the village or commune level, with 'champion farmers' and 'cross-visits' used to lead local change. The adoption of applied change management principles to improving regional biosecurity may assist current efforts to control and eradicate transboundary diseases in the Mekong region. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

This article examines the impact on production of an intervention in the Ecuadorian Sierra designed to improve returns to potato production through training and through linking smallholders to high-value markets. Critical to identifying the impact of the programme is the careful construction of a counterfactual and meticulous data collection. To assess the impact of the programme on production, a weighted estimation, where weights are constructed through propensity score matching, is employed to estimate a production function within a damage abatement framework. The function incorporates a series of interaction terms to assess the impact of the programme on the production technology. The findings provide evidence that the programme enhances yields both through a general shift in technology as well as increased input use. The results suggest that the use of effective farming techniques that are learned through the programme induce this technological shift. © 2010 The Agricultural Economics Society.},

	abstract = {In Morocco, large-scale irrigation schemes have evolved over the past twenty years from the centralised management of irrigation and agricultural production into more complex multi-actor systems. This study analysed whether, and how, in the context of state withdrawal, increased farmer autonomy and political liberalisation, family farmers currently participate in the coordination and negotiation of issues that affect them and involve scheme-level organisations. Issues related to water management, the sugar industry and the dairy sector were analysed in five large-scale irrigation schemes. Farmer organisations that were set up to intervene in water management and sugar production were seen to be either inactive or to have weak links with their constituency; hence, the irrigation administration and the sugar industry continue to interact directly with farmers in a centralised way. Given their inability to voice their interests, when farmers have the opportunity, many choose exit strategies, for instance by resorting to the use of groundwater. In contrast, many community-based milk collection cooperatives were seen to function as accountable intermediaries between smallholders and dairy firms. While, as in the past, family farmers are still generally not involved in decision making at scheme level, in the milk collection cooperatives studied, farmers learn to coordinate and negotiate for the development of their communities. © 2010 Water Alternatives.},

	abstract = {Vulnerability and limited assets both constrain the options of poor people, especially smallholder farmers. But the poor often also possess a range of potentially valuable natural, physical, financial, human and social-capital assets. Development interventions requiring high levels of assets that poor people do not have are unlikely to reduce poverty, but those which build on what they do have can build assets and so improve their options. Producing and processing potatoes are important livelihood strategies for millions of the poor. A careful understanding of the context and strategies of the poor can help indicate how potatoes can also be used to reduce poverty. This paper employs the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to examine these issues, using the Papa Andina case in the Andes as an example of new approaches to use potato diversity to improve livelihoods in a transforming development context. The Papa Andina regional initiative, together with its national partners, helps Andean farmers build new livelihood strategies using the genetic diversity of potatoes, local knowledge and social capital - assets that are often undervalued. But this does not occur in a vacuum; a range of policies and institutions are required, including, for example, collective action among farmers and interaction with outsiders such as market agents and agricultural service providers in order to foster market chain innovation and to access and build market opportunities. Accurate understanding of the changing context of producers, processors and consumers can help ensure that potatoes play a role in improving the welfare of the poor. © 2009 Earthscan.},

	abstract = {Maize production is of critical importance to smallholder farmers in Ghana. Various factors limit the productivity of smallholder maize farming systems undergirded by the lack of capital for critical investments both at the farm and at national policy levels. Using a value chain approach, this diagnostic study explains how a complex configuration of actor interaction within an institutionally and agro-ecologically challenged value chain leads to the enduring absence of maize farming credit support. We find a cycle of credit rationing resulting from value chain challenges such as agro-ecological uncertainties, inadequate GAPs training, weak farmer groups and market insecurity. This condition is sustained by an interplay between mistrust, insufficient information across the value chain and inadequate control strategies in the maize credit system. We argue that Digital Platforms (DPs) show potential to help overcome some information and communication gaps and related uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangements. This is promising in terms of aiding awareness and coordinated responsiveness to agro-ecological farm conditions and the development of farming records databases. Thus, DPs could generate new networks and forms of cooperation in the maize value chain in this regard. As a tool for mediating trust in value chain credit cooperation, strategic use of these DP contributions could help initiate an entry point for recalibration of trust perceptions. Significant considerations and improvements are however needed to harness DPs effectively in mediating trust for maize credit provision, not least being farmer digital inclusion in DP implementation, effective intermediation and network governance arrangements and digital contributions towards cost-effective agro-ecological controls in the erratic maize farming context. This approach to trust building should therefore not be viewed as a quick fix but as a process of trial and error, and learning by doing. © 2018 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences},

	abstract = {Background: Smallholder farmers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable to climate shocks but often lack access to agricultural insurance. Weather index insurance (WII) could reduce some of the problems associated with traditional, indemnity-based insurance programs, but uptake has been lower than expected. One reason is that WII contracts are not yet sufficiently tailored to the needs and preferences of smallholder farmers. This study combines survey and choice-experimental data from Kenya to analyze the experience with an existing WII program and how specific changes in the contractual design might encourage uptake. Results: Many smallholders struggle with fully understanding the functioning of the program, which undermines their confidence. Regular provision of relevant rainfall measurements and thresholds would significantly increase farmers' willingness to pay for WII. Mechanisms to reduce basis risk are also positively valued by farmers, although not to the same extent as higher levels of transparency. Finally, offering contracts to small groups rather than individual farmers could increase insurance uptake. Conclusions: Better training on WII and regular communication are needed. Group contracts may help to reduce transaction costs. Farmer groups can also be important platforms for learning about complex innovations, including novel risk transfer products. These concrete results are specific to Kenya; however, they provide some broader policy-relevant insights into typical issues of WII in a small-farm context. © 2018 The Author(s).},

We use the notions of institutional carriers and activity systems to study the evolution of the prevailing “smallholder” institutional logic of Ghanaian agriculture toward an incoming “value-chain” institutional logic concerned with linking farmers to output markets, improving the knowledge base in agriculture, and increasing its information intensity. We draw on a mixed-methods approach, including in-depth qualitative interviews, focus groups, observations, and detailed secondary quantitative data. We cultivate activity theory as a practice-based lens for structuring inquiry into institutional change. We find that information artifacts served to link the activities of farmers that were embedded in the smallholder logic with those of agricultural-development actors that promoted the value-chain logic. Hybridization occurred through the use of artifacts with different interaction modalities. In terms of conceptualizing change, our findings suggest that hybridization of the two logics may be an intermediary point in the long transition from the smallholder toward the value-chain logic. © 2018 by the Association for Information Systems.},

Using data from field observations, 86 interviews, and 13 focus group discussions from five municipalities, the research finds that cross-scale activities, including local plans and multi-stakeholder forums, and municipal budgeting processes, influence adaptation and mitigation to climate change in smallholder farming systems. Furthermore, using matrix analysis and stakeholder responses, we identify interactions, synergies, conflicts, and potential co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation, and food production practices. The analysis of climate-resiliency field school practices shows that the addition of livelihood outcomes to smallholder farming landscapes strengthen adaptation, mitigation, and food production outcomes (and vice versa). Climate-resiliency Field Schools have promoted the practice of organic farming, various systems for rice intensification, and the establishment of community seed banks. Other practices, such as soil conservation, reforestation, and agroforestry, have been used in Mindanao to maintain carbon stocks while increasing crop production. Climate-resiliency Field Schools serve as a multilevel institutional platform where farmers can access climate information, which they can use to improve farm planning (i.e., choices of crops, timing of farm preparation, and harvest). The research findings suggest that climate-smart interventions are highly location-specific, technically rigorous, involve knowledge-intensive processes, and are influenced by the knowledge and capacities of local farming communities and implementing partners. We conclude with some suggestions for the design of programs, and the types of interventions that are required to sustain and ultimately scale up efforts to enhance climate-smart agriculture. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The results showed that 65.68\% of the differences were caused by individual-level factors, and 34.32\% were caused by provincial-level factors. The factors at the individual level, including the improvement of production equipment (IPE), education of farmers (EOF), regularization of management rules (RMR), and difficulty level of getting loans (DLL), had positive effects on growth of family farm, whereas the frequency of staff participating in training (FST) had a negative effect. At provincial level, improvement of the support policy system (IDSPS) could strengthen the positive correlation between RMR and growth of family farm. Moreover, the factor IDSPS combined with ability of agricultural cooperatives providing social services (AACPS) and spacious degree of technology access channel (SDTAC) could strengthen the positive correlation between EOF and growth of family farm, and reduced the negative correlation between FST and dependent variable. The results suggested that government should support farms to improve production equipment and financing pattern, transfer the method of re-education of grain family farmers, promote the standardization of grain family farms, establish a sound policy support system, improve the social service ability of agricultural cooperatives, and broaden the channels of technology acquisition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Sustainable management of watersheds and environmental friendly economic activities are vital for sustained water flow, steady supply of ecosystem services for societal needs and enhancement of aquatic vegetation and animal species. The problem of the failure to capture actual values of ecosystem services from watersheds and incorporate them in the national income accounting is profound in developing countries which are characterized with constrained budget for financing conservation programs. To resolve this problem attention has moved to market based instruments such as payment for watershed services (PWS). However, the approach to elicit the necessary information for PWS to kick off is still lacking. Furthermore, Ecohydrology, defined as an integrative sustainability science using the interactions between hydrology, biota and natural processes as management tools to reinforce ecosystem services on a broad range of landscapes (Zalewski, 2015) is a basis for the development and application of market-based approaches in watershed conservation. This study investigated small holder farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for watershed services in Pangani River Basin. A contingent valuation method was employed to elicit the willingness to pay for watershed conservation. A probit model was used to determine respondents’ response to WTP and factors conditioning the maximum amount they are WTP. Findings indicates that majority of respondents are willing to pay for watershed services. Similarly, result reveals that marital status, household size and distance from the water source positively influence smallholder farmers’ WTP and the maximum amount to be paid. Equally important occupation, household size, income from irrigation, and amount paid for irrigation were found to negatively influencing smallholder farmers’ WTP. The result also revealed that education level, total land size and yield from irrigated farm plot positively influence smallholder farmers’ WTP. These results therefore, indicate that establishment of PWS is feasible. © 2016 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences},

	abstract = {Perennial grain crops are an example of a 'transformative technology,' in which the functionality and science of the technology differ in a fundamental manner from conventional grain crops. A review of the literature indicates that the motivation for farmer adoption of transformative technologies is complex and poorly understood. At the same time, many studies have found concern and awareness about environmental issues to be significantly and positively correlated with the adoption of no-till agriculture, organic farming and agroforestry. Building on these insights, we conducted an ex ante study of perennial wheat adoption among 11 farmers from Michigan and Ohio. Perennial wheat is not yet commercially available, so a semi-structured interview format was chosen to allow for in-depth discussions of the crop's potential characteristics and uses. Consistent with the literature on transformative technology adoption, farmers who approached us to learn more about perennial grains described soil and environmental quality as their primary motivations for doing so. Farmers suggested a total of ten different uses for perennial wheat, only one of which was mentioned specifically by interviewers. This diversity of proposed uses implied a wide range of criteria for adoption. A striking result was that the ability of perennial wheat to compete with annual wheat on the basis of yield, a focus of researchers, was brought up by only one of the interviewees, as many farmers proposed perennial wheat as a means of solving a problem for which no other crop provided an adequate solution, often by planting perennial wheat on an under-used or marginal area of the farm. This is suggestive that interacting with farmers could alter priorities in perennial grain improvement, as has occurred in other radically transformative agriculture technologies. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.},

It is necessary to expand some eco-friendly soil-management practices to address serious environmental issues. Using data from 646 small-farm households in Shandong, China, perceptions of eco-friendly soil-management practices and land degradation, adoption attitudes and final adoption decisions are all evaluated, and the factors affecting farmers’ final adoption decisions are estimated by applying a logit model. The results show that the perception levels of land degradation and eco-friendly soil-management practices are very high, and more than 70\% of the respondents indicated that they wanted to adopt the practices; however, only a small portion of the interviewed farmers made the final decision to apply these practices. Of all the factors, perception of practices and adoption attitude were the most important ones influencing farmers’ adoption decision positively. Knowledge of environmental regulations, risk type, degree of farmland fertility, agro-technical training, participation in agricultural insurance, interaction with other farmers and membership in farmers’ organizations had positive relationships with adoption decisions, whereas availability of farming funding influenced adoption decisions negatively. According to these findings, ensuring agricultural profit is the primary basis for farmers’ adoption decisions; however, agricultural information—especially information about eco-friendly soil-management technologies—should also be widely dispersed, and environmental regulations should be strictly enforced. © 2016 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.},

	abstract = {Shifting agricultural land management to one that promotes the use of biological control alongside insecticide spray, requires two key elements: 1) habitat for natural enemies provided by non-crop area within the agricultural landscape, and 2) judicious use of insecticides by farmers. However, barriers to adoption may include low levels of knowledge regarding pests and natural enemies, and the difficulties associated with coordinating among community members. The acts of practicing cautious spraying and of leaving aside land as non-crop habitat (NCH) for natural enemies incur private costs for benefits shared by the community. In this study we tie together several objectives within the analysis of a framed field experiment built around pest management decisions in a smallholder agricultural context. We present results from a within-subjects design (multiple treatments per game group) that estimates a decision model which links behavior back to characteristics of the game, the players, and their group. We examine the relative role these sets of characteristics have in explaining variations in the modeled decisions, including how farmers respond to a nudge (a flat subsidy for allowing land to sit as non-crop habitat) to promote natural enemy services on the land. We observe that group-level characteristics appear to have the greatest roles in explaining how decisions by individuals are made. That is to say, the decision of whether to adopt greater use of NCH has more to do with those around the farmer than the traits of the farmer him or herself. From a policy point of view, it is a signal that (if such game outcomes have any bearing on farm-level decisions) conventional data tools (such as household-level data products from household surveys or censuses) may be inadequate in evaluating appropriate incentives, and newer approaches that identify social networks and neighbor/community interactions may be important. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of the principles (no-tillage and mulching) and components (fertilization and weeding) of conservation agriculture (CA) on crop productivity and weeds, and the interactions between principles and components, and to suggest strategies for introducing CA to smallholder farmers. The treatments consisted of tillage, fertilizer application, residues management and weed control strategies. While combined analysis showed that mulching is as effective as tillage in controlling weeds, the interaction between site and treatment revealed that in the more humid environment of Zidyana, weed dry matter obtained under no-tillage and residues plus fertilizer (NT+F+R) was 0.6 mg ha-1 lower than under CP+F. Results suggest that about 6.0 mg ha-1 of mulch is required to have a similar effect as tillage in controlling weeds. Fertilizer had an overriding effect on maize yield, regardless of tillage and crop residue management. Mulching was beneficial over tillage in the drier environment of Manjawira, where maize yield obtained under NT+F+R was 1.2 mg ha-1 greater than under CP+F. Our results show that the introduction of no tillage has benefits only if it is accompanied by fertilizer application, retention of crop residues as surface mulch, and improved weed control. Increasing availability and accessibility of inputs (fertilizers and herbicides) to farmers is critical for adoption of CA at scale in Malawi. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

	abstract = {Knowledge-based development interventions for improved natural resource management have long advocated for the integration of local and outsiders' knowledge. Participatory and conventional approaches frame this as a dialogue between "local" and "scientific" knowledges, using the relative strengths of each stakeholder's experience to reinforce knowledge gaps. While the epistemological and methodological challenges of such dialogue are well-documented, this study uses a community-based learning project for integrated soil fertility management in western Kenya to explore the less understood dynamics of dissonance between and within knowledge systems. While participatory research did build a dynamic expertise for soil fertility management shared by both smallholder farmers and scientists, divergent expectations and understandings emerged after the initial enthusiasm of shared learning. This included scientists assessing farmers as "not very good" researchers and farmers seeing researchers as "not very good" farmers. Dissonances between actors' different understandings of soil, the research process, and each other had multiple implications, including on the validity of conclusions reached by different actors and on the possibility for scientific support for local experimentation. While many dissonances ultimately fueled learning and improvements to the project, this required both farmers and scientists to move beyond initial critiques of each other's knowledge and practices. At their worst, dissonant knowledge claims were actually political ones, hiding competition for control of the development process. Recognizing the nature and extent of dissonances is therefore a crucial step in understanding how best to apply limited resources and disciplinary expertise within participatory teams attempting to build hybrid knowledge. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This article investigates how a one-to-one support process based on the use of a whole dairy farm simulation tool helps both farmers to reflect on their production strategies and researchers to better understand the farmers' contexts of action and decision. The support process consists of a minimum of four discussion sessions with the farmer: designing the Initial Scenario and formulating a diagnosis, building and simulating the Project Scenario corresponding to the objective targeted by the farmer, building and comparing alternative scenarios proposed both by the farmer and the researcher, and evaluating the process with the farmer. The approach was tested with six smallholder farmers in Brazil. It is illustrated with the example of one farmer who aimed to develop his milk production by more than doubling his herd size on the same cultivated area. Two other examples illustrate the diversity of issues addressed with this approach. The first estimates the sensitivity of economic results to price variations of milk and concentrates. The second compares two scenarios in terms of forage supply autonomy. The discussion assesses the outcomes of the approach for farmers in terms of response to their specific issues and of knowledge acquired. The research outputs are discussed in terms of the value and limits of using simulation tools within both participatory action research and advisory processes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The value of trees in fields generally decreased with increased rainfall and with increased fertiliser inputs. The model only supports the extensionists' recommendations that trees should be removed from fields in the case where farmers can use high inorganic fertiliser levels, and for high rainfall regions. However, even under these conditions, 1-2 trees ha-1 may need to be retained for the value of shade. The model further predicts intercropping with trees where fertiliser inputs are low or absent, and where rainfall is low. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {A participation scheme involving smallholder dairy farmers in improving dairy productivity through the use of local feeds, on-farm established feeds and crop residues was carried out in the Northeast, Thailand. At six milk collection centers, 63 farmers with 340 lactating cows participated in this research and demonstration of feed supplements. Farmers and cows were allotted to receive respective feed supplements: high-quality feed block (HQFB), high-quality feed pellet (HQFP), dried cassava leaf/cassava hay, dried leucaena leaf and cottonseed meal: 5\% urea treated rice straw was fed as a source of roughage throughout the feeding period of the dry season. Trainings and workshops were organized by the researchers at the University, research station, demonstration sites and on-farms. Regular visits to the farms by researchers and extension officers were made while discussions and demonstrations were performed in addition. Participating farmers also visited other farmers during the demonstration which offered a real practical perspective and farmer-to-farmer interaction. As a result of this participation and demonstration scheme, the farmers could learn more effectively and accepted the technology more readily, especially the practicality of the feed preparation, feed establishment, feeding method and feed reserve. Strategic supplementation of these feed supplements resulted in improving milk yield, milk quality, overall condition of the cows and higher income return through increased productivity and lower level use of concentrate to milk yield from 1:2 to 1:3 or lower. Based on this research and demonstration /participation scheme, all feed supplements enhanced productivity, however the establishment of cassava hay on farms deserved more attention and warrants a wider developmental expansion among dairy farmers since it contained high rumen by-pass protein (tannin-protein complex) and could be easily produced and be sustainable on farms.},

This paper assesses the role of economic, social, political and organizational processes on technology adoption in smallholder livestock production systems based on innovation systems perspective. Functions of the innovation systems framework was used to assess the missing links in the dairy sector value chains. The results show that weak or missing innovation systems functions such as entrepreneurship, knowledge diffusion, market development, and policy advocacy mirror the low uptake of improved technologies in the livestock sector. Shortage of domestic suppliers of key technological inputs and services, weak input and output markets and weak interaction among value chain actors have been the major hindrances to livestock development. For example, there were no reliable sources of improved breeds of dairy heifers, veterinary supplies, quality semen, and equipment. The results suggest that technical knowledge and availability of economic opportunities alone may not be enough to stimulate the uptake of technologies and commercialization of dairy production. The peculiar nature of inputs, services, and output in the livestock sector requires innovative business models that can facilitate the coordination of knowledge, skills, inputs, services and output markets in livestock value chains. © 2018 The Author},

Recognizing the significance of the challenge, this paper explores the nature of the stakeholder interactions surrounding the development of Saint Lucia's 2009–2015 National Agricultural Policy and considers some of the implications for food and agriculture-related policy outcomes. Results reveal a general lack of supportive conditions for effective multi-stakeholder processes, including low stakeholder participation levels, conflicting roles of different forms of social capital in the interactions between stakeholders, and missing “boundary” organizations capable of facilitating a transition towards more flexible and adaptive institutions, enhanced knowledge exchange and learning, and greater trust among stakeholders in the policy network.

This scientific network brings together research and academic institutions, with expertise spanning a multidisciplinary perspective from biology and ecology to remote sensing, agronomy and integrated pest management. Its main scientific objective is to explore the potential of biodiversity and ecological processes such as pest regulation, enabling novel ecologically-based models for productive systems, reduction of pesticide use, and adaptation or resilience of farming systems in the face of environmental disruptions. From Northern Senegal to Southern Benin, the research group explores a wide range of ecoregions and socio-ecological contexts, including stakeholders and their objectives, land use and agricultural practices, and management of biodiversity for enhancing biological control. Main challenges to be turned into opportunities include (i) encouraging collaborations amongst researchers from different scientific fields, (ii) fostering interactive research and synergies among research institutions and among countries, and (iii) developing an ecological engineering approach for the design of sustainable agricultural systems for smallholder farmers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on a qualitative research process, we compare two individual livelihood strategies from rural Hungary, the case of a family farmer and a potter. We argue that scientific, local and managerial knowledge forms cannot be identified in pure forms in Hungarian rural initiatives. In the absence of a strong networking capacity, rural entrepreneurs replace knowledge-sharing and community-learning processes with individual knowledge-gathering strategies. As a consequence, person-bound, multifaceted knowledge sets are used in rural initiatives and are produced according to context; however, the absence of knowledge dynamics hinders actors in developing sustainable solutions. Thus, rural development policy should encourage interaction among different rural actors instead of aiming at providing better education for managerial knowledge. © Journal compilation © 2008 European Society for Rural Sociology.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous crop identification has been the subject of much concern, since smallholder farms less than 1 ha are the main agricultural form in many areas, especially China. Remote sensing with high spectral and spatial resolutions via aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides a potential alternative technique for the monitoring of heterogeneous crops in smallholder agriculture. Although this new type of remote sensing data with high spectral and spatial resolutions provides the possibility of fine classification, it also brings some challenges, such as bands contaminated with severe noise, the nonuniform distribution of the discriminative spectral information, and the spectral variability of crops. In this study, we attempted to resolve these problems by developing a robust spectral-spatial agricultural crop mapping method based on conditional random fields (SCRF), which learns the sensitive spectral information of the crops by a spectrally weighted kernel, and uses the spatial interaction of pixels to improve the classification performance. Data from a manned aircraft platform and a UAV platform were chosen to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can effectively use the relative utility of each spectral band to detect the bands contaminated with severe noise, and it uses the spectrally weighted kernel to consider the sensitive spectral information of the crops. The algorithm with only a spectrally weighted kernel showed an improvement of more than 4\% over the classical support vector machine and random forest methods. Moreover, the spatial information was proved to be of crucial importance for crop classification, and both the object-oriented method and the proposed SCRF method can improve the classification performance in terms of both visualization and the quantitative metrics by considering the spatial information. Compared with the object-oriented method, SCRF can deliver a better classification performance, with an accuracy improvement of more than 2\%. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Oil palm is an important industrial, livelihood and food crop in Ghana. Smallholders produce the bulk of the palm fruits and small-scale processors, mainly women, produce most of the crude palm oil. Poor practices lead to a high proportion of free fatty acids in the crude palm oil and the processors thus cannot access remunerative national and international markets. Exploratory and diagnostic studies identified the absence of rules and regulations governing processing as a major factor. An innovation platform was convened and facilitated to remove the identified institutional constraints. Based on event tracing, this paper reports a study of the effects of the innovation platform's interventions and how these were achieved. Institutional entrepreneurs are shown to play important roles: they mobilised resources such as expertise, knowledge, access to information and high-level political power to influence small-scale processors to adopt alternative practices. The institutional changes observed are shown to arise in cooperation between traditional authorities (chiefs), the district legislature and authorities at the national level, who together institutionalised the experimental actions and processes taken in the study area. The institutional elements they most affected were: rules and regulations, the legitimacy of new practices and organisational arrangements, co-generation of knowledge, material resources, and the strategic and communication skills of key actors. © 2016 S.

Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted as part of an evaluation of field-based farmer learning approaches introduced by SOFECSA in Zimbabwe. Building on emerging farmer interactive platforms, data were collected using farmer participatory research approaches. Findings: Over 90\% of the farmers identified the national extension agents as the farmers' most preferred and reliable sources of information on ISFM, with farmer-to-farmer interactions ranking second. Non-governmental organisations and the print media emerged as the least trusted sources of agricultural technical information. Field-based learning centres, which enabled interactive evaluation of different ISFM options, constituted 50\%, indicating that they were major platforms for information and knowledge sharing. Uptake of ISFM was influenced by farmer resource group and farmers' visits to learning centres. Farmer experience and access to extension services were, in turn, the major factors influencing farmers' use of ISFM information. Approaches that support farmer-to-farmer interactions are required and learning centres are a suitable platform for such interactions to occur. Practical implications: The article brings to attention the role of learning centres in fostering adoption of ISFM technologies. Insights on the need to support and strengthen agricultural extension in rural smallholder communities are provided. Originality/value: This is a unique study exploring the role of farmer-oriented information and knowledge management in promoting complex technologies such as ISFM.

	abstract = {Simulation models are effective tools to examine interactions between livestock, cropping systems, households, and natural resources. Our study objective was to use an integrated livestock and crop model to assess the outcomes from selected suites of management decisions observed in smallholder sheep-cropping systems of Yucatán, Mexico. The scenarios contrasted specialized systems versus mixed farming, and evaluated the outcomes of increased crop-livestock integration. Mixed enterprise scenarios involving sheep provided more income than specialized enterprises, and capitalized on a lower price of on-farm maize grain, efficient utilization of surplus labor, and availability of common land. Labor and management income was greatest for the unintegrated and partially integrated crop and livestock scenarios. It was more profitable for producers to sell excess grain and maize stover, and use common land to feed the livestock, suggesting that increased integration does not always result in improved outcomes. The results are consistent with a system not yet pushed to the point where integration is inevitable. For all sets of scenarios, the model structure was able to accommodate subtle management differences to produce appropriate biophysical, labor, and economic outcomes. We conclude there is potential to use similar model development methods to describe other crop-livestock systems, thus providing tools for learning, scenario analysis, and impact assessment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {At global scale nutrient flows are unbalanced, resulting in huge surpluses in Western Europe versus negative balances in Africa. Existing policy and socio-economic environments in different parts of the world are the major cause of this situation. At lower spatial scales, a much more complex and diverse picture emerges. In Sub-Saharan Africa, different levels and causes of soil fertility decline are found among agro-ecological zones, soil types, farm systems, wealth groups, urban-rural households, cash and food crops, home fields and bush fields. Technology development has been the traditional response to address nutrient imbalances in general, and soil fertility decline in Africa in particular. Farm households have continued to develop and adapt existing technology to changing situations. National and international research institutions have followed a variety of changing approaches of which the recently developed participatory approaches have yielded some impressive results in isolated cases. These efforts have, however, not led to the necessary massive reversion of the trend in soil fertility decline. The Dutch policies on nutrient use and the Indonesian policy to adopt Integrated Pest Management are two examples, associated with such major trend reversions. This suggests that promoting and supporting participatory technologies have limited impact when no attention is paid to participatory policy development and implementation. In order to mobilise farm households in a trend reversion, a number of conditions should be met such as stable prices for agricultural outputs, better input/output prices ratios, influence of land users on the research agenda and private-public initiatives focused on smallholders. This observation calls for the establishment of interactive landusers-science-policy triangles at various scales (local, national and international) in which joint learning and mediating may lead to more informed decision making, more focused design of an agricultural sector policy, implementation of policies by effective institutions, and appropriate technology development and implementation. Interventions need to be reoriented: less technology development, more policy influence and institution building. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: The term “traditional” is well established in European (human) medicine and even appears in recent European regulations on herbal medicinal products connected to a simplified registration. In contrast, a scientific discussion of a Traditional European Veterinary Herbal Medicine is still lacking in spite of a rising interest, in herbal medicine for animals in particular of veterinarians. There is only limited systematic ethnoveterinary research in Europe, with exception of the Mediterranean region, Switzerland and Austria. We conducted a survey on the ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers in the pre-alpine and alpine regions of the Swiss cantons of Bern and Lucerne. We compared the findings with earlier studies conducted in Switzerland and with recent and past human and veterinary medicinal literature. Aim of the study: We wanted to know to what extent (dependent to different definition of the term “traditional”) the ethnoveterinary knowledge of Swiss farmers could be considered as “traditional” in a European veterinary medicinal context. Material and methods: Semistructured interviews with 44 dialog partners, mainly smallholder cattle farmers, were conducted in 2014. Detailed information about homemade herbal remedies (plant species, plant part, manufacturing process) and the corresponding use reports (target animal species, category of use, route of administration, dosage, source of knowledge, frequency of use, last time of use and farmers satisfaction) were collected. To compare our data with literature, one German book of veterinary pharmacology published in 1900, one typescript of Swiss lectures in veterinary pharmacology from 1944, four books of veterinary herbal medicine published between 1984 and 2016, and one recent publication comparing current Swiss (human) ethnomedicinal plant knowledge with modern and past literature were analyzed. Results: Information on a total of 315 homemade remedies containing one single plant species (homemade single species herbal remedy reports, HSHR) was collected from participating farmers. These HSHR were prepared from 83 plant species belonging to 46 botanical families. Plants of the families Asteraceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae were most frequently used. Matricaria recutita L., Calendula officinalis L., Quercus robur L., Thymus vulgaris L. and Symphytum officinale L. were the most frequently documented species. A total of 404 use reports (UR) were gathered for the 315 HSHR. The largest number of UR was for treatments of gastrointestinal disorders and metabolic dysfunctions, followed by skin alterations and sores. For more than half of the UR the source of knowledge was family, ancestors and friends, and for approximately one quarter the information was from courses and other educational events. For nearly 90\% of the UR farmers mentioned at least one use during the last 10 years, and in more than 50\% of the UR the last use was within the past year. Compared with recent and past literature and depending on different definitions of the term “traditional” as used for human medicine, between 43\% and 84\% of all 83 and between 57\% and 100\% of the most often mentioned 21 plant species show a “traditional” European veterinary use. Conclusion: For the treatment of their animals farmers in the pre-alpine and alpine regions of the Swiss cantons of Bern and Lucerne mostly used plants which have a track record as medicinal herbs in Europe over several centuries. Almost half of the plant species had specific veterinary uses for about 120 years and even more for at least 30 years. The majority of the plant species thus fulfill the criteria of “traditional” according to several definitions and even more up to a certain degree the criteria of “traditional use” as defined in European regulations for human medicinal products. Ethnoveterinary research combined with data from historical sources may serve as a sound foundation for the development and definition of a Traditional European Veterinary Herbal Medicine maybe even with regard to the recent discussion about a simplified registration for Traditional Herbal Veterinary Medicinal Products. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

We employ a triple-hurdle model to examine the effect of internet and phones on Peruvian smallholder farmers’ market participation, marketplace choice, and volume decisions using household-level data from the IV National Agricultural Census of Peru in 2012. Double matching at the district- and household-levels is implemented to address potential selection bias. Results indicate a positive direct effect of internet and phones on farmers’ market participation and volume decisions on the national market. Those with ICT access are more likely to sell on the foreign market than those without ICT access. The marginal effects suggest that internet access tends to have larger impacts on volume decisions than phones. In addition to direct effects, we find that internet access has significant and positive spillover effects on market participation and volume decisions in the national market. Without implementing matching procedures, the magnitude of the ICT effect tends to be smaller. Results provide empirical support for policies and social programmes that promote ICT especially internet usage in rural Peru to improve smallholder farmers’ marketing performance. © 2017 The Agricultural Economics Society},

	abstract = {The rubber boom across much of Southeast Asia has led to environmental destruction, and the resultant crash in the price of rubber has destabilised livelihoods. We investigated the necessary factors required to enable a transition towards a more sustainable model for rubber cultivation in Southwest China (i.e. the ‘greening’ of rubber cultivation), using a framework for the integrative study of multiple aspects in complex land use issues. We present findings from stakeholder interviews and a stakeholder workshop, and discuss their relevance within and beyond Southwest China. The current focus of researchers and development practitioners tends to be on finding technical solutions to address unsustainable rubber cultivation practices. However, stakeholder consultations revealed that the key barriers were more social: low levels of trust and knowledge exchange between stakeholder groups and fragmented visions about the future of the landscape. It is very important to continue the economic prosperity initially brought by rubber, but, without improved communication between government and researchers and smallholder farmers, this will be very difficult to achieve. A wider landscape perspective is needed to address issues in rubber cultivation to avoid repeating the same problems of cash crop boom and bust experienced with other crops, most notably bananas. We conclude that more effort should be put into developing mechanisms that integrate technical knowledge, enhance social relationships, and present a forum for reconciling – or at least acknowledging – the differing needs, knowledge, and objectives of different groups, and transcending the power dynamics between smallholder farmers and government and researchers. © 2016 The Author(s)},

Using a field experiment with ex ante matching in a factorial design, it was established that showing agricultural extension videos significantly increased farmers' knowledge. However, results suggested impact pathways that went beyond simply replicating what was shown in the video.

Agroecology is a broad concept considered to have transformative potential, yet as a research field it has often been technology-centred and focused at the local level. Building on the experiences of Ugandan agroecologists working in an array of agricultural professions throughout the country, this paper identifies and discusses major barriers to agroecology in Uganda. Inductive analysis of qualitative data from interviews and focus groups generated four types of interacting barriers; constraints at farmer level, an agricultural knowledge system favouring conventional approaches, adverse and intertwined political and economic interests, and cross-cutting ideological and discursive pressures. These broad challenges become manifest in the accounts presented, making clear that barriers to and therefore also appropriate strategies for advancing agroecology must be treated as contextual even if a ‘global movement’ is emerging around it. The discussion suggests theoretical lenses for further inquiry into agroecology and its realization in light of these constraints. © 2016 Taylor \& Francis.},

	abstract = {The low productivity of smallholder farming systems and enterprises is attributed mainly to the limited resources of farming households and to the application of inappropriate skills and practices that can lead to land degradation. Land productivity may be raised by improved soil and water management and by mechanization (considering the whole spectrum of power sources) that makes better use of human labour and other resources. However, mechanization programmes, which facilitate soil and water management, have to consider cultural and social factors as well as the immediate technical and economic issues. The livelihoods approach provides a framework for dealing with such considerations, which can be elicited through the participation of farmers in the research and development activities. Examples are given of participatory research (i.e. research in which scientists and farmers participate as partners) to raise smallholder productivity sustainably in India, Zimbabwe and Latin America. Sustainability is a key issue for economic security in the longer term, and depends on many interacting factors both within and outside the tasks of crop production. The most significant of these factors are discussed and it is emphasized that involving farmers provides a reliable means of accounting for them and enabling the farmers to apply new knowledge to raise productivity, but within the contexts of their own livelihood strategies. © 2002 Silsoe Research Institute.

	abstract = {Orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) can contribute to combating vitamin A deficiency and establishing more resilient cropping systems in sub-Saharan Africa. There is limited understanding of the factors that affect yield and quality of OFSP on smallholder farmers’ fields. This study aimed to assess the performance of six OFSP varieties, identify factors limiting productivity and explore options to close the gap between actual and attainable OFSP yields on fields of smallholder farmers. Data were collected in the 2015/16 growing season from 221 on-farm variety demonstrations in seven districts in Central and Southern Malawi. Dependent variables of interest included crop establishment, vine yields, storage root formation, root yields, percentage of marketable root yield, and weevil infestation. Using linear mixed models, a range of biophysical, climatic, management and socio-economic factors and variables was used to identify associations with these dependent variables. The root yield gap was explored using a multivariate boundary line model to identify the most yield limiting factors. Results show a large variability across farmers’ fields and a wide range of interacting factors affecting the variables of interest. Varieties Chipika and Kadyaubwerere attained good yields and were preferred by farmers in terms of taste. Varieties Zondeni and Anaakwanire gave a poor root yield, but a good vine yield. Timely planting is crucial to attain good root yields by making better use of the available rainfall. There was a varietal effect on weevil infestation and Kaphulira was most affected. Weevil control is required for market-oriented producers to enhance the percentage of marketable roots. The average attainable fresh root yield ranged from 18 t ha−1 for Zondeni to 32 t ha−1 for Mathuthu, against actual yields of 5–9 t ha−1. Elevation, planting date, rainfall and crop establishment could explain only 28 percent of the average yield gap, while 49 percent was explained for Mathuthu. Other factors that may explain the yield gap, but were not included in the model are: tillage methods and soil nutrient limitations. Male host farmers received better quality cuttings and planted in better soil moisture conditions, resulting in better establishment and vine yields. OFSP productivity can be enhanced through gender-sensitive extension, by ensuring male and female farmers can plant clean planting material of a suitable variety early in the rainy season. This requires additional efforts in vine multiplication of the required variety prior to the onset of the rains. © 2017 The Authors},

Our research aims to provide insights to help strengthen sustainable family farming. We focus on initiatives that have advanced sustainable family farming innovations in Colombia and analyse the factors and dynamics that have led to the limited penetration of those innovations across the country. To that aim, a transformative methodology is applied involving representatives of farmers’ associations, supporting organisations and researchers from various disciplinary fields. We analyse the network of initiatives against the conceptual background of sociotechnical niches and identify a stable niche where generic lessons are being systematically identified and used to establish replication projects. However, this niche is still limited in its breadth, which results in a low capacity for expansion and a strong dependency on international donors for reproducing experiences. Specific recommendations are outlined for broadening the type of actors involved in the interpretation and dissemination of lessons from the niche. Moreover, we outline suggestions for further research and conceptualisation in two directions: for exploring effective ways of broadening the niche and translating niche lessons to state policies and for deepening the understanding of interactions between the niche and other levels. © 2017, Springer Japan KK.},

Findings reveal significant pitfalls in PVS that resulted from emergence of spoiler factors such as new crop disease and unpredictable floods. Spoiler factors curtailed sustainability of participatory gains. Besides, learning during critical field stages was thin due to participatory lapses. For instance, an average of only 8\% (total. = 1488) consistently participated in each key stage of PVS learning trials in western Kenya. The majority (92\%) participated on average once, especially in the end-of-season field day when final ranking of crop varieties was done. Consequently, this majority engaged in impulse buying, due to poor grasp of salient productivity factors underlying attractive traits of the new germplasm. Essentially, post-PVS sustainability conditions were elusive. Scaling out of PVS gains was hence compromised and early adopters often fell back to old varieties, to experience, or to sporadic extension advice. PVS therefore has to be anchored within an integrated knowledge exchange system that addresses challenges emanating from interaction of smallholder social, spatial and temporal contexts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Rearing of scavenging chickens is among the most commonly practiced farm activities in Ethiopia. This system is dominated by indigenous chickens. Output from indigenous chickens is low due to poor management and absence of intense selection that is intended to improve economically important traits. This showed that village chickens are rather evolved for adaptation traits. However, the level of risk is low, and this has made rearing of scavenging chickens a choice of farm activity for smallholder farmers. The objective of this study was to characterize the scavenging chickens' production system in Wolaita Zone. Single-visit survey involving individual interview of 119 farmers and 6 focus group discussions was used to collect the data. Our results showed that rearing of scavenging chickens was constrained especially by disease and predation problems. However, farmers proposed a set of solutions to minimize the effect of these problems. Rearing of scavenging chickens fulfils the multi-functional need of the society. This system has special features because it can sustain in its own without the need for modern commercial chicken farming facilities. However, farmers also reported the drawbacks of rearing of scavenging chickens and these mainly include uproot of garden crops and tiresomeness of the night watching. Selection of chickens was mainly depending on physically observed traits like body size and plumage colour. The initial foundation flock was mainly obtained from the local market. The ideal place for scavenging chickens production is the one that has intermediate weather condition and has some trees that can be used as shade; however, it was substantiated that it has to be free from bush and shrubs, weeds and wet lands. Therefore, these pieces of knowledge embedded among smallholder farmers need to be well documented and synthesized to design an appropriate type of technology packages that can be communicated back to farmers to improve productivity of the scavenging chickens. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The research underlying this report investigated factors affecting the scaling-up of selected livestock products in Brazil, India, the Philippines, and Thailand, with particular attention directed at understanding issues affecting small-scale producers. Scaling-up is defined here as growth in the average size of farm in terms of annual livestock sales. The urgency of the topic is driven by the fact that livestock are among the few commodities that smallholder farmers widely produce that are growing rapidly in demand, and thus the interest for poverty alleviation is strong. However, there are signs that smallholders may ultimately be displaced from this source of livelihood by competition from larger-scale farms. Furthermore, the rapid growth in production of pigs and poultry has also been associated with significant environmental problems in the zones of most rapid growth. The interactions between overall growth in production, size of farms, and sustainability are crucial to rural poverty alleviation in a sustainable manner. Therefore, the objectives of the research were to assess whether the market share of large farms is growing relative to small farins and, if so, why. The analysis is directed primarily toward the issues of efficiency in production and its determinants, but also deals with the unit costs of inputs received and the unit prices for outputs obtained. The study specifically does not investigate the likely existence of economies of scale in output marketing, which are anecdotally thought to be large and will over time largely work to the disadvantage of independent (nonintegrated) farmers, especially small-scale ones. This important topic is deferred to a different study on contract farming in poultry and dairy using different data and approaches. The research was pursued by setting up models and collecting farm-level data to test the following hypotheses: • Small-scale producers have profits per unit of output that are higher than or equal to those of large producers. • Small-scale producers are more efficient users of farm resources to secure profits than are large producers, other things equal. • Small farmers expend a greater amount of effort or investment in abatement of negative environmental externalities per unit of output than do large farmers. • Uncompensated negative environmental externalities favor the nominal profit efficiency of large farms over small ones, ceteris paribus. • Profits of small producers are more sensitive to "transaction costs" than are those of large-scale producers. • Contract farmers are more profit-efficient than independent farmers at comparable scales of operation. Chapter 2 looks at evidence of growth and concentration of the livestock sector and establishes that scaling-up in livestock production is in fact occurring in all four countries studied. It suggests that production in the 1980s and 1990s tended to concentrate around capital cities and other major demand centers with the exception of Brazil. Since the late 1990s, larger-scale farms have been increasingly locating in remoter areas farther away from population centers, disease, and environmental challenges. Smallholder output continues to grow at high rates in certain cases, such as that of dairy farmers in India and swine producers in the Philippines, but the output from large-scale enterprises is growing even more rapidly, taking market share away from smallholders. This is particularly relevant in Brazil and Thailand, where there are relatively small numbers of small-scale producers left in the broiler business and the role of smallholders in both dairy farming and swine production is shrinking in relative terms. The question, then, is whether large-scale livestock production will outcompete that of smallholder producers everywhere and eventually provoke their exit from the sector. To analyze the scaling-up of livestock production, Chapter 3 defines a quantitative measure of relative farm competitiveness in production based on the use of stochastic profit frontiers estimated for each country and commodity, with technical inefficiency effects included, following the approach of Battese and Coelli (1995). It looks at factors that differ across farms that might explain higher relative competitiveness of specific farms. These factors include the usual determinants of profit efficiency, such as prices faced by the farm and fixed farm resources not traded in markets, asymmetries in access to assets (credit, liquidity, fixed capital) and information (education, experience, communication facilities), externalities (some farmers get away with uncompensated pollution, while others do not), and policies (some get a better deal from the state than do others). Chapter 4 describes field surveys that were conducted on cross-sections of farms of different sizes (small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale or commercial) and type of production arrangement (independent and contract). Chapter 5 summarizes the descriptive results of the survey and seeks to establish through descriptive statistics scale-related differences in farm-specific transaction costs, such as access to information and input and output markets, to direct further analytical work on explaining farm profit per unit of output. Results show that small-scale producers across the countries studied are characterized by small landholdings, low levels of education, few years of experience in livestock production, moderate use of inputs, and limited access to input and output markets. Large-scale farm households, therefore, may have a better chance of overcoming high transaction costs than do small-scale producers. On the other hand, smallholders have a chance to compete with larger-scale producers if they can cost family labor at less than the full opportunity cost of hired labor doing the same tasks on larger farms, perhaps because much of the labor on small farms consists of extra tasks performed by women or children who are at home for other reasons. The study does not claim that the opportunity cost of family labor is zero, but it repeats the relevant calculations with family labor costed either at full market wage rates or not at all, with the correct answer postulated to fall somewhere in the resulting range between the two. Chapter 6 first discusses the likely impact of scaling-up of livestock production on the environment, then investigates the issue of whether large-scale sample farms make less of an effort per unit of output to mitigate pollution through expenditures on lagoons, manure spreading on farm land, and other mitigation activities than do small-scale sample farms in the study countries. If so, by hypothesis they would be polluting more per unit of output than are small farms, assuming that each unit of output produces the same effluent regardless of production system. Results show that across countries and commodities, small-scale farms have higher environmental mitigation "expenditures" per unit of output than large-scale farms. The exceptions are poultry farmers in Thailand, where large-scale operations in the densely settled export-certified zone spend more per unit than smaller farms, and dairy farmers in Thailand, where the larger-scale farmers have more crop land per animal than do the smaller-scale farmers in the sample. Results are backed up by a second, more conventional procedure that estimates mass balances of nutrients per hectare added to farm soils on different farms. Again, it is shown that large farms load more excess nutrients per hectare of land than do small farms, suggesting that in fact large farms benefit from a higher uncompensated environmental externality per unit of output than do small farms, giving them a distorted cost advantage. Chapter 7 reports the econometric evidence from stochastic profit frontier analysis using the Battese-Coelli (1995) approach to technical inefficiencies on why some farms are relatively more profit-efficient than others at making farm profits from livestock. Chapter 8 then ties these results together with the preceding descriptive analysis. The main findings are as follows: • Independent small farms in India and the Philippines typically have higher profits per unit than do independent large farms, but this is not the case for large and small contract farms. On the other hand, large independent farms are relatively more profit-efficient than small independents almost everywhere, suggesting that over time they will continue to outcompete smallholders and gain further market share. India, where most farms are small and dairy dominates, is a notable exception. • In Brazil and Thailand in particular, where scaling-up has already occurred to a large extent in monogastrics, the outlook for independent smallholder producers of the items studied is not rosy. In the Philippines, there is considerable scope on economic grounds for the improvement of smallholder fanning through vertical coordination of those farms that are presently a little larger than the bottom 20 percent of the size distribution of farms, especially for swine producers. • Small farms have less of a negative impact on the environment than do large farms. Hence, environmental concerns are compatible with promoting small-scale livestock production. Large farms that are more environmentally responsible are also more competitive within the class of large farms (particularly Philippine broiler and swine farms). Efficient large-scale production is compatible with good environmental behavior, although it seems likely that both are correlated with some third factor, such as the chicken and swine inventory held on-farm or the ability to sell manure produced on-farm.},

	abstract = {Intercropping with maize (Zea mays L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the widely used practices of producing food crops on smallholder farms in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, the knowledge on the options toward intensification of available practices in order to optimize systems productivity using intercrops is generally lacking. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of intercropping, cropping seasons, and different varieties of common bean on productivity of the maize-common bean based intercrop through 5 cropping seasons from 2015 to 2017. Experimental site is located at 03°18 ′03.74′' S and 37°12′13.94′ E and an altitude of 956 m above sea level in the northern highlands of Tanzania. Hybrid maize Dekalb brand (DK 8031) and two varieties of common bean (improved Lyamungu 90 and local Mkanamna) were used. The treatments within a replicate were: (1) sole crops: (i) maize, (ii) local bean, (iii) improved bean, and (2) intercrops: (i) maize + local bean, (ii) maize + improved bean. Interaction and individual effects of cropping seasons (S) (periods of years – short and long rains), varieties of common bean (V), and cropping systems (C) (sole and intercrop) were studied. Results indicated that S × V interaction was significant on bean grain yield and 100-seed weight. Improved bean outweighed the local bean with grain yields ranging from 2.2–3.5 t ha-1 and 0.2–2.5 t ha-1, respectively. The effect of S was significant on all measured variables in beans and the effect of M was only significant on total biomass. Further, S significantly affected all measured variables in maize and grain yields ranged from 2.3–2.6 t ha-1. In maize, correlations were strong (r = 0.48*; P = 0.0325) between maize grain yield and ground coverage of leaf canopy measured 42–56 days after sowing. The land equivalent ratios (LERs) for maize intercropped with improved and local beans were 1.48 and 1.55, respectively but LER values did not differ significantly between bean varieties. In this study, both common bean varieties were sown simultaneously with the maize, which might have resulted in their differential performance. It is recommended that studies are conducted to evaluate time of introducing this legume crop to a maize system such as early sowing, sowing mid in the season after a maize crop is well established, and sowing late in the season when the leaves in maize plant have started to senesce. © 2019 The Author(s)},

Farmer participatory research (FPR) is an important approach to help ensure relevance and define locally adapted solutions for enhanced adoption of sustainable agriculture (SA) technologies. The mother and baby trial (MBT) design has proved effective as a FPR approach to address challenges on smallholder farms. The MBT systematically links long-term “mother” trials, where slow and erratic processes can be monitored, to “baby” trials led by farmers to capture a wide range of farm practices and environmental contexts. Communication and learning is facilitated through MBTs as well. This distributed FPR approach documents the performance of technologies in diverse contexts and provides multiple opportunities for joint planning, observation, and reflection. We describe two MBT case studies, one within a developing country context (Malawi) and the other representing a novel application of MBT within an intensive agriculture context (Michigan). To explore tradeoffs in SA performance, multiple domains (productivity, environmental, and economic) are presented via radar charts as a visualization tool. In both FPR experiences, farmer perspectives and a wide range of practices were revealed. In Malawi, a mesic site was associated with steep SA tradeoffs compared with a marginal site. In Michigan, diversity in tillage practices, field crop performance, and soil health were found to be conditioned by the environment. Overall, the MBT approach supported the development of SA technologies adapted to local conditions. © 2019 The author(s).},

	abstract = {Wheat rust diseases pose one of the greatest threats to global food security, including subsistence farmers in Ethiopia. The fungal spores transmitting wheat rust are dispersed by wind and can remain infectious after dispersal over long distances. The emergence of new strains of wheat rust has exacerbated the risks of severe crop loss. We describe the construction and deployment of a near real-time early warning system (EWS) for two major wind-dispersed diseases of wheat crops in Ethiopia that combines existing environmental research infrastructures, newly developed tools and scientific expertise across multiple organisations in Ethiopia and the UK. The EWS encompasses a sophisticated framework that integrates field and mobile phone surveillance data, spore dispersal and disease environmental suitability forecasting, as well as communication to policy-makers, advisors and smallholder farmers. The system involves daily automated data flow between two continents during the wheat season in Ethiopia. The framework utilises expertise and environmental research infrastructures from within the cross-disciplinary spectrum of biology, agronomy, meteorology, computer science and telecommunications. The EWS successfully provided timely information to assist policy makers formulate decisions about allocation of limited stock of fungicide during the 2017 and 2018 wheat seasons. Wheat rust alerts and advisories were sent by short message service and reports to 10 000 development agents and approximately 275 000 smallholder farmers in Ethiopia who rely on wheat for subsistence and livelihood security. The framework represents one of the first advanced crop disease EWSs implemented in a developing country. It provides policy-makers, extension agents and farmers with timely, actionable information on priority diseases affecting a staple food crop. The framework together with the underpinning technologies are transferable to forecast wheat rusts in other regions and can be readily adapted for other wind-dispersed pests and disease of major agricultural crops. © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The study investigates whether access to agricultural extension services enhances the well-known positive impact of adopting Drought Tolerant Maize (DTM) technology on livelihood outcomes; maize yield, output per capita, consumption and sales using a representative dataset of smallholder farming households from Zimbabwe. The empirical analysis adopts an instrumental variable regression model that incorporates an endogenous interaction term to capture the intermediary role of institutional extension services. Results reveal that access to agricultural extension services enhances the relationship between DTM adoption and maize yield, output per capita, and consumption but appears to weaken the association between DTM adoption and the amount of maize set aside for sale. In exploring the potential reasons why access to institutional extension services might enhance the DTM adoption-livelihood outcomes relationship, the results suggest mechanisms related to the use of basal fertilizers, use of organic manure, access to agricultural credit, use of certified DTM seed, access to general production and marketing information, weeding frequency and disease control which are more likely to be influenced by access to agricultural extension services. The findings suggest that policies targeted at improving DTM adoption as a climate-smart agricultural technology to improve resilience of smallholder maize farming households to climate variability and change must be complemented by revitalized agriculture extension services. Revitalization of extension services may come through capacity building of extension institutions, and their personnel, improving agricultural extension infrastructure, mobility of extension personnel, and increased financing to such institutions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study is a qualitative survey of the effectiveness of communication between agricultural extension personnel and smallholder farmers in the Gweru district of Zimbabwe. Extension communication, particularly, has a large bearing on the sustainability of agricultural developments projects. The apparent lack of information, education and training during the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) of Zimbabwe contributed to low agricultural production and productivity which could consequently lead to continuing food insecurity in the country. The findings indicate a discrepancy between work experience and qualifications of the extension workers which could imply a lack in the quality of knowledge, information and skills imparted to the resettled farmers. Further findings indicate a lack of stakeholder analysis in designing agricultural communication projects and an absence of a multi-media communication approach to enhance adoption of agricultural innovations. The study concludes that agricultural extension is not adequate due to multiple resource constraints. The findings imply that agricultural communication should be integrative. A model of smallholder agriculture stakeholder mobilization has been developed to encourage effective agricultural communication and productivity therein. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Polycultured agrarian systems in Ecuadorian Amazonia (also called chakras or swollen gardens) are characterised by a market-oriented crop for the generation of monetary income, for example, cocoa, other agricultural products (e.g., banana and cassava), and livestock for family farm consumption. Moreover, a chakra is an outstanding example of agroforestry production, in which ecological, social and economic elements co-evolve from a set of close and strong connections. In this context, the conservation and transformation of their biological subsystems can be understood as the result of complex interactions between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic factors. In turn, such interactions are essential to provide food and monetary income to the indigenous community. Relevant agency capabilities exist that could cause an agroforestry system to take a different path of co-evolution, that is, towards greater or lesser sustainability associated with different levels of complexity. In conclusion, chakras have key ecological features that can mitigate the impact of human population growth in Amazonia. Additionally, chakras have their own processes of social self-regulation which enhance the possibilities of adaptation of Kichwa communities to changing environmental conditions, being essential elements in local food sovereignty, equitable gender relations and the respect of ancestral wisdom. © 2017 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Plant genotypes are rarely developed for mixed cropping systems despite the potential of these systems to provide multiple ecosystem services. One of the most ubiquitously grown mixed cropping systems is a common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) intercrop, but there is little consensus among researchers, and few known studies document farmer knowledge, about superior bean genotypes specifically for this intercrop system. Participatory plant breeding (PPB) is a well-accepted method of selecting varieties with farmers and could be a useful tool for identifying genotypes for intercrops. We used sole crop and intercrop PPB on-farm trials (n=13) and interviews (n=59) to document farmer knowledge about climbing bean genotypes and adaptation for intercrops in Rwanda, where smallholder farmers have traditionally grown beans and maize for generations. Results: Qualitative analysis demonstrated that farmers considered distinct attributes for different cropping systems. In intercrops, farmer evaluation prioritized five factors: universal traits and trait-based competitive ability, intrinsic competitive ability, environmental adaptation, and management. Farmers consider intrinsic competitive ability crucial, whereas most other studies have neglected this attribute in intercrop breeding strategies. Furthermore, farmers identified specific attributes that constitute an intercrop bean ideotype: adaptation, restricted height, columnar plant structure, even distribution of pods, fewer leaves, and earlier maturity. Farmers also had specific techniques for testing cropping system and environment interactions. Conclusions: PPB on-farm trial evaluations and interviews with farmers allowed us to combine traditional agroecological knowledge with plant breeding research to generate new knowledge that contributes to our understanding of intercrop breeding and bean traits for intercrops. Farmers demonstrated sophisticated understanding of methods to identify genotype adaptation, competitive ability, and specific traits that together create a bean ideotype for maize-bean cropping systems. Empowering farmers through on-farm testing of diverse genotypes, and even populations, could be a practical solution to expensive genotype by environment trials and improve the identification of highly adaptive and productive genotypes for diverse and resilient cropping systems. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Many smallholders in Nepal rely on marginal lands that are subject to declining fertility due in part to traditional farming practices. The adoption of conservation agriculture practices has the potential to improve livelihoods and food security but depends on knowledge sharing among farmers, extension agents, and researchers. This study uses Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine farmer, extension professional, and researcher preferences for selected conservation agriculture production systems (CAPS) and a widely-practiced traditional production system. This data is then used to determine which CAPS have the highest likelihood of adoption and identify misunderstandings or knowledge gaps among farmers, extension personnel and scientists. AHP was conducted in three tribal villages and at two NGOs that provide research and extension services to smallholders in the central Middle Hills region of Nepal. Overall, soil quality was identified as the most important factor affecting long-term household income, the primary motivator of adoption in study villages. Farmers generally preferred full tillage followed by cowpea solo crop in the second growing season while extension agents and researchers preferred strip tillage followed by cowpea and millet intercrop in the second season. Results indicate that (1) stakeholders prefer CAPS over traditional systems, (2) farmers prefer full tillage over minimum tillage and (3) the farmers in the village of Khola Gaun may be more prepared to adopt minimum tillage and intercropping than the other villages. Communication among all stakeholders should be improved and the results of on-farm plots should be used to reinforce understanding of CAPS benefits. It should be kept in mind that labor savings is not a main motivator of adoption among village farmers and further research should be conducted in Khola Gaun to learn why farmer preferences there differ significantly from farmer preferences in other villages. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The paper aims to show that these services can be understood as a system whose functioning is strongly determined by the financing mechanisms, the governance mechanisms put in place, the quality of human resources delivering advice, and the characteristics of the advisory method. The study is based on an analysis of two case studies in Benin and Burkina Faso using a common framework derived from an agricultural advisory system approach. The study highlights the strong interaction between the different components of the system. It shows that (i) the intervention method needs to be continuously adapted to take into account changes in financial capabilities and human resources available for providing advisory services, (ii) the nature and the quality of advisory activities are closely related to the skills of advisors and managers of advisory services, (iii) the governance mechanisms steering advisory services reveal the social relations between the stakeholders and influence the content of the advice, and (iv) the funding mechanisms are pivotal in defining the rules of governance.

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that mineral fertilizers must play an important part in improving agricultural productivity in western Kenyan farming systems. This paper suggests that for this goal to be realized, farmers' knowledge must be strengthened to improve their understanding of fertilizers and their use. We analyzed smallholder knowledge of fertilizers and nutrient management, and draw practical lessons from empirical collective fertilizer-response experiments. Data were gathered from the collective fertilizer-response trials, through focus group discussions, by participant observation, and via in-depth interviews representing 40 households. The collective trials showed that the application of nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) alone was insufficient to enhance yields in the study area. The response to P on the trial plots was mainly influenced by incidences of the parasitic Striga weed, by spatial variability or gradients in soil fertility of the experimental plots, and by interactions with N levels. These results inspired farmer to design and conduct experiments to compare crop performance with and without fertilizer, and between types of fertilizers, or responses on different soils. Participating farmers were able to differentiate types of fertilizer, and understood rates of application and the roles of respective fertilizers in nutrient supply. However, notions were broadly generated by unsteady yield responses when fertilizers were used across different fertility gradients, association with high cost (especially if recommended rates were to be applied), association of fertilizer use with hybrids and certain crops, historical factors, among other main aspects. We identified that strengthening fertilizer knowledge must be tailored within existing, albeit imperfect, systems of crop and animal husbandry. Farmers' perceptions cannot be changed by promoting more fertilizer use alone, but may require a more basic approach that, for example, encourages farmer experimentation and practices to enhance soil properties such as carbon build-up in impoverished local soils. © 2010 The Author(s).},

By using a new approach, called zooming-in zooming-out, the videos were of regional relevance and locally appropriate. When the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) introduced them to Africa in 2005, many scientists and civil servants thought that the videos would be culturally inappropriate and hence irrelevant to African smallholder farmers. However, African farmers whowatched the videos did not experience cultural barriers. In fact, they enjoyed seeing another part of the world where farmers faced similar problems as theirs, and were able to solve these problems by themselves. To promote wider uptake of the videos a key challenge was to overcome the institutional barriers. Public sector agencies especially had to be convinced that African smallholders appreciated Asian videos. By watching the videos with farmers and listening to their feedback, the skeptical scientists and service providers changed their minds. By 2009, the Bangladeshi rice seed videos had been translated into 20 African languages and so became national products. Videos made according to the zooming-in zooming-out approach can bring farmer-to-farmer extension to a higher level of social aggregation. © 2010 Wageningen University.},

The purpose of analysing processes that use or build social capital is to derive a framework or checklist of stages and characteristics that can be used to analyse the extent of social capital use and generation in other communities. The qualitative design is suitable for a study such as this, which investigates possible relationships and influencing factors concerning learning and changes to farm management practices. Data collection involved observing a learning activity session and interviewing 12 members in a focus group during the session and subsequently 14 individually at their farms. Data were analysed for themes and coded with the assistance of NUD*IST qualitative data analysis software. An understanding of how what is identified as social capital can be built in a formalized learning programme can be used to facilitate social capital building; in other formal learning settings, as well as more widely. The findings of the study reported here and findings from studies of informal learning in geographic communities have contributed to the development of the Centre for Research and Learning in Regional Australia's model of the simultaneous building and use of social capital.

	abstract = {Climatic change has a negative impact on people's livelihoods, agriculture, freshwater supply and other natural resources that are important for human survival. Therefore, understanding how rural smallholder farmers perceive climate change, climate variability, and factors that influence their choices would facilitate a better understanding of how these farmers adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. A Zero-inflated double hurdle model was employed to estimate the factors influencing farmers’ adoption of adaptation strategies and intensity of adoption at the household level in South Africa. Different socioeconomic factors such as gender, age, and experience in crop farming, institutional factors like access to extension services, and access to climate change information significantly influenced the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among beneficiaries of land reform in South Africa. Concerning intensity of adoption, age, educational level, farming experience, on-farm training, off-farm income, access to information through ICT and locational variables are the significant determinants of intensity of adaptation strategies. Thus, education attainment, non-farm employment, farming experience are significant incentives to enhance smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity through the adoption of many adaptation approaches. This study therefore concluded that farm-level policy efforts that aim to improve rural development should focus on farmers’ education, on-farm demonstration and non-farm employment opportunities that seek to engage the farmers, particularly during the off-cropping season. The income from non-farm employment can be plough-back into farm operations such as the adoption of soil and water conservation, use of improved planting varieties, insurance, among others to mitigate climate variability and subsequently increase productivity. Policies and investment strategies of the government should be geared towards supporting education, providing on-farm demonstration trainings, and disseminating information about climate change adaptation strategies, particularly for smallholder farmers in the country. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations around the agricultural extension system and education on climate change using information and communication technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Achieving SI requires smallholder farmers to have access to information that is context-specific, increases their decision-making capacities, and adapts to changing environments. Current extension services often struggle to address these needs. New mobile phone-based services can help. In order to enhance the public extension service in Tanzania, we created a digital service that addresses smallholder farmers’ different information needs for implementing SI. Using a co-design methodology–User-Centered Design–we elicited feedback from farmers and extension agents in Tanzania to create a new digital information service, called Ushauri. This automated hotline gives farmers access to a set of pre-recorded messages. Additionally, farmers can ask questions in a mailbox. Extension agents then listen to these questions through an online platform, where they record and send replies via automated push-calls. A test with 97 farmers in Tanzania showed that farmers actively engaged with the service to access agricultural advice. Extension agents were able to answer questions with reduced workload compared to conventional communication channels. This study illustrates how User-Centered Design can be used to develop information services for complex and resource-restricted smallholder farming contexts. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Prior knowledge about community vulnerability levels is crucial to minimizing potential losses from future threats. Most vulnerability studies focus on high-impact disasters and their temporal and spatial analyses. Yet high-frequency, low-impact disasters have a cumulative potential to severely disrupt or damage socioeconomic systems. There is limited knowledge especially in the global south about the creation of vulnerability to hydrometeorological threats. Using a systems approach, this study explores ways in which communities in the northern semiarid tropics of Zimbabwe are vulnerable to hydrometeorological threats. This predominantly qualitative study used literature review, interviews, transect walks, and focus groups to gather data from selected samples involving smallholder farmers with in-depth knowledge about community vulnerability. The results show that the communities are vulnerable to multiple hydrometeorological threats due to multiple interacting factors including rainfed and flood-based farming, land tenure, topography, climate, and other socioeconomic conditions such as inadequate income sources and high poverty. In order to reduce vulnerability, this study provides five policy options for government and nongovernmental organization interventions, including the need to transform rural economies beyond the traditional rainfed and flood-based farming systems. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The risks posed for disease introduction and spread are believed to be higher for smallholder livestock producers than commercial producers. Possible reasons for this is the notion that smallholders do not implement appropriate animal health management practices and are not part of traditional livestock communication networks. These factors contribute to the effectiveness of passive disease surveillance systems. A cross-sectional study, using a postal survey (n = 1,140) and group interviews (28 participants in three groups), was conducted to understand the animal health management and communication practices of smallholders keeping sheep, cattle, pigs, dairy goats and alpacas in Australia. These practices are crucial for an effective passive surveillance system. Findings indicate that there is a need for improvement in animal health management practices, such as contact with veterinarians and attitudes toward reporting. Results also indicate that these practices differ depending on the livestock species kept, with sheep ownership being associated with lower engagement with surveillance activities and smallholders keeping dairy goats and alpacas having in general better practices. Other factors associated with surveillance practices among participant smallholders are gender and years of experience raising livestock. Despite the differences observed, over 80\% of all smallholders actively seek information on the health of their livestock, with private veterinarians considered to be a trusted source. Emergency animal diseases are not a priority among smallholders, however they are concerned about the health of their animals. The finding that veterinarians were identified by producers to be the first point of contact in the event of unusual signs of disease, strengthens the argument that private veterinarians play a vital role in improving passive surveillance. Other producers are also a point of contact for animal health advice, with government agencies less likely to be contacted. The effectiveness of on-farm passive surveillance could be enhanced by developing strategies involving both private veterinarians and producers as key stakeholders, which aim to improve awareness of disease and disease reporting responsibilities.

	abstract = {Access to climate information has the potential to build adaptive capacity, improve agricultural profitability, and help manage risks. To achieve these benefits, knowledge of the local context is needed to inform information development, delivery, and use. We examine coffee farming in the Jamaican Blue Mountains (BM) to understand farmer livelihoods, opportunities for climate knowledge to benefit coffee production, and the factors that impinge on farmers’ ability to use climate information. Our analysis draws on interviews and 12 focus groups involving 143 participants who largely cultivate small plots. BM farmers currently experience stresses related to climate, coffee leaf rust, and production costs that interrelate concurrently and with time lags. Under conditions that reduce income, BM farmers compensate by adjusting their use of inputs, which can increase their susceptibility to future climate and disease stresses. However, farmers can also decrease impacts of future stressors by more efficiently and effectively allocating their limited resources. In this sense, managing climate, like the other stresses, is an ongoing process. While we identify climate products that can help farmers manage climate risk, the local context presents barriers that argue for interactive climate services that go beyond conventional approaches of information production and delivery. We discuss how dialogs between farmers, extension personnel, and climate scientists can create a foundation from which use can emerge. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

To be better prepared for and resilient to uncertainty and disturbances in the future, resource users and managers need to further develop knowledge about the food and farming system, with its dominating feedback structures and complexities, and to test robust and integrated system-based solutions. This paper investigates how participatory system dynamics modeling can be adapted to groups at the community level with low or no formal educational background. The paper also analyses the refinement of workshop participants’ mental models as a consequence of a participatory system dynamics intervention. For this purpose, we ran two workshops with small-scale farmers in Zambia. Analysis of workshop data and post-workshop interviews shows that participatory system dynamics is well adaptable to support an audience-specific learning-by-doing approach. The use of pictures, objects and water glasses in combination with the basic aspects of causal loop diagramming makes for a well-balanced toolbox. Participants acquire understanding that is also relevant beyond systems thinking in that it offers a range of practical insights such as a critical evaluation of common food security strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Nonetheless, such opportunities are often lost largely due to unfavorable regulations imposed on harvesting and marketing of timber. Adverse impacts are worsened because the regulations are not effectively communicated to smallholder farmers. We assessed the level of smallholder knowledge of existing regulations and found it very low. In part, this correlated to their socio-demographic characteristics. Poor literacy skills and a low level of education make it difficult for older farmers’ to increase their knowledge. This is compounded by the limited information channels that can reach the farmers. Improving smallholders’ knowledge by providing information concerning markets and regulations in a timely and clear manner could help smallholders exercise coping strategies and priorities when selling their timber that would in turn reduce the negative impacts of regulations. The roles of village authorities could be crucial. They are close to the smallholders and could channel the information. The government could provide training and incentives for them to be more active in communicating the regulations to the smallholders. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

	abstract = {Background: The Nutrition Embedded Evaluation Programme Impact Evaluation (NEEP-IE) study is a cluster randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of a childcare centre-based integrated nutritional and agricultural intervention on the diets, nutrition and development of young children in Malawi. The intervention includes activities to improve nutritious food production and training/behaviour-change communication to improve food intake, care and hygiene practices. This paper presents the rationale and study design for this randomised control trial. Methods: Sixty community-based childcare centres (CBCCs) in rural communities around Zomba district, Malawi, were randomised to either (1) a control group where children were attending CBCCs supported by Save the Children's Early Childhood Health and Development (ECD) programme, or (2) an intervention group where nutritional and agricultural support activities were provided alongside the routine provision of the Save the Children's ECD programme. Primary outcomes at child level include dietary intake (measured through 24-h recall), whilst secondary outcomes include child development (Malawi Development Assessment Tool (MDAT)) and nutritional status (anthropometric measurements). At household level, primary outcomes include smallholder farmer production output and crop-mix (recall of last production season). Intermediate outcomes along theorised agricultural and nutritional pathways were measured. During this trial, we will follow a mixed-methods approach and undertake child-, household-, CBCC- and market-level surveys and assessments as well as in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with project stakeholders. Discussion: Assessing the simultaneous impact of preschool meals on diets, nutrition, child development and agriculture is a complex undertaking. This study is the first to explicitly examine, from a food systems perspective, the impact of a preschool meals programme on dietary choices, alongside outcomes in the nutritional, child development and agricultural domains. The findings of this evaluation will provide evidence to support policymakers in the scale-up of national programmes. © The Author(s). 2017.},

Participatory processes have been institutionalized in public extension and have brought new meaning to both extension and understanding rural development. The interactive engagement of smallholder farmers by public extension and the conducive environment created by the approach for other service providers to interact with communities has brought many advantages. The participation of women and youth, the poor and vulnerable groups in generating information and solutions to address food security and other rural needs has been impressive. The knowledge gained from the interaction has contributed in influencing policy change and research priorities. Smallholder farmers have formed common interest groups, which has enabled them to move from subsistence to business farming associated with increased knowledge, increased productivity and increased demand for produce. The approach has enabled extension service providers to reach more farmers per year than they did previously. The partnerships created between public extension with other institutions contributed to enhancement of knowledge and skills that has enabled the approach to spread to more areas in the country. Further capacity development among the extension providers and formulation of supportive policies that encourage demand-driven extension will lead to further improvement of the approach and scaling up. © 2011 Earthscan.},

	abstract = {Population increases, land-use changes and marketing opportunities are important factors affecting crop-livestock integration particularly with respect to their effect on soil fertility and feed supply for ruminant livestock. As the human population density rises, crop farmers and grazers are finding it profitable to establish contracts for paddocking, and they are reaching agreement on equitable ways to make use of crop residues and take care of livestocks. As the processes of intensification proceed, mixed crop-livestock systems are evolving as the viable and dominant farming system, allowing smallholder farmers to capitalize on the complementarity between crops and livestock. Strategies directed to raise the productivity of specific crop-livestock systems need to consider the stage of development of the target area in relation to intensification and the nature of crop-livestock interactions. Information related to crop and livestock systems in West Africa is currently available from various sources e.g., household surveys, aerial surveys, rural appraisal, experimental etc., and held by different agencies. The approach used in this study shows how such data (biophysical and socioeconomic) can be integrated within a GIS environment and synthesized to identify the evolution of systems across environments and also to identify constraints and potential of the systems. Potential for integrated crop-livestock systems remains untapped and/or knowledge of its existence is unknown for large parts of Nigeria. Using data from 36 case studies and georeferenced data on cropping intensities and livestock population for the entire country, it was possible to predict emerging crop-livestock systems using GIS. Indeed, depending on availability of data, it is now possible to extend a similar approach in other African countries. The potential contribution of this technology is largely unknown in West and Central Africa, where few operational programs use them. Major technological innovations and appropriate government policies have potential to shift the balance in regional developments, if targeted carefully at areas where the right conditions exist. Further research could then target specific areas thus ensuring efficient allocation of resources while policy makers can achieve development goals by directing policies and resources to domains that have the greatest potential.},

This region, which is known for its monsoon climate (which involves a distinct temporal and spatial variation in rainfall), has experienced a decrease in annual rainfall over the last century. This study is aimed at investigating how smallholder farmers perceive climate change and at identifying the methods that these smallholders use to adapt to climate change. We use data collected from a survey of 215 households to compare the climate vulnerability of three watershed communities in Kerala. We find that the farmers perceive substantial increases in both temperature and the unpredictability of monsoons; this is in accordance with actual observed weather trends. The selection of effective adaptation strategies is one of the key challenges that smallholders face as they seek to reduce their vulnerability. The surveyed households simultaneously use various adaptation methods, including information and communication technology, crop and farm diversification, social networking through cooperatives, and soil and water conservation measures. The results of a binary regression model reveal that the household head's age, education and gender, as well as the farm's size and the household's size, assets, livestock ownership, poverty status and use of extension services, are all significantly correlated with the households' choices regarding adaptations to cope with climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

A descriptive statistical analysiswas conducted, and Kendall'sW-test and the chi-squared distribution test were deployed to categorize and evaluate the efficacy of the different methods of technology diffusion used by the Tunisian extension system. To address farmers' perceived opinions and classify the changes from the use of the improved technologies, a qualitative approach based on the Stapel scale was used. Farmer training, demonstration, and farmer-to-farmer interactions were perceived as the most effective agricultural extension methods. The access to technology, know-how, adoption cost of that technology, and labor intensity for adoption influenced its adoption level. Farmers' opinions about the changes resulting from the adoption of both technologies revealed that yield and resistance to drought were the most important impacts of the two technologies.

We describe an ecological-economic land-use change model as an integrated, exploratory tool used to analyze how tropical land-use change affects ecological and socio-economic functions. The model analysis seeks to determine what kind of landscape mosaic can improve the ensemble of ecosystem functioning, biodiversity, and economic benefit based on the synergies and trade-offs that we have to account for. More specifically, (1) how do specific ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage, and economic functions, such as household consumption, relate to each other? (2) How do external factors, such as the output prices of crops, affect these relationships? (3) How do these relationships change when production inefficiency differs between smallholder farmers and learning is incorporated? We initialize the ecological-economic model with artificially generated land-use maps parameterized to our study region. The economic sub-model simulates smallholder land-use management decisions based on a profit maximization assumption. Each household determines factor inputs for all household fields and decides on land-use change based on available wealth. The ecological sub-model includes a simple account of carbon sequestration in above-ground and below-ground vegetation. We demonstrate model capabilities with results on household consumption and carbon sequestration from different output price and farming efficiency scenarios. The overall results reveal complex interactions between the economic and ecological spheres. For instance, model scenarios with heterogeneous crop-specific household productivity reveal a comparatively high inertia of land-use change. Our model analysis even shows such an increased temporal stability in landscape composition and carbon stocks of the agricultural area under dynamic price trends. These findings underline the utility of ecological-economic models, such as ours, to act as exploratory tools which can advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the trade-offs and synergies of ecological and economic functions in tropical landscapes. © 2018 Dislich et al.

	abstract = {Smallholder livestock producers are a diverse population with wide ranging motivations for keeping livestock. The biosecurity risk posed by smallholders has been the subject of much conjecture, with comparisons often made between the level of animal health and biosecurity knowledge of smallholders, versus that of commercial livestock producers. This research aimed to gain a better understanding of current knowledge of smallholder production in Australia, particularly in relation to biosecurity and emergency animal disease, and to investigate the relationships that exist between smallholders and the organisations and individuals from which they seek information, assistance and support. Engagement with stakeholders is an important component of an effective biosecurity communication strategy as the dissemination of biosecurity related information from a single source cannot be expected to satisfy the needs of such a broad ranging population. A qualitative study involving a review of literature, semi-structured interviews with government and non-government stakeholders and the development of smallholder and stakeholder influence and interest grids was undertaken. This paper forms part of a broader mixed methods research project among smallholders. Results from the stakeholder analysis showed variation in the parameters used to define smallholders and in the level of stakeholder involvement. Smallholders identified breeding consultants, other producers, private veterinarians and family, friends and colleagues as having a significant to high level of interest and potential to influence their practices. Government agencies were perceived to only have some level of interest but significant influence. Industry stakeholders and rural suppliers were positioned in the quadrant reflecting perceived low levels of interest and influence. The interest and influence grid developed from stakeholder's perspectives demonstrate a clustering around the mid points for both interest and influence, with the exception of those from industry who described low levels of interest and influence. Commonwealth and State government stakeholders reported a higher level of interest than influence. Veterinarians, both government and private, reported some to significant levels of interest and influence. In contrast to the results from the smallholder grid, rural suppliers reported relatively high levels of both interest and influence. The current study demonstrates that to maximise the effectiveness of biosecurity communication, there is a need for government and industry organisations to further engage with all stakeholders involved with smallholders. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {There is limited field-based research and recommendations on the effect of cattle feeding management practices on smallholder dairy farms (SDF) for the growing dairy industry in Kenya. This controlled trial aimed to determine the effect of feeding locally produced dairy meal (DM) on early lactation daily milk production (DMP) on Kenyan SDF, controlling for other factors associated with DMP. Privately owned, recently calved cows (n = 111) were randomly assigned to one of three groups of feeding recommendations for DM (meeting predicted DM requirements by: (1) 100\%; (2) 50\%; or (3) feeding by the farmer's discretion). DM was provided for free to groups 1 and 2 to ensure they had sufficient DM to feed to the recommendations. Data collection on cow and farm characteristics occurred biweekly for a 60-day period post-calving starting in June 2013. A repeated measures multivariable linear regression model was used on the DMP outcome variable. With variability in DM consumption within feeding groups due to variability in DMP, actual DM fed was assessed as an independent variable rather than assigned feeding groups. DMP was positively associated with each kg/day of DM fed (0.53 kg/day), cow weight (0.13 kg/day), feeding DM in the month prior to calving (1.42 kg/day), and feeding high protein forage (0.41 kg/day), and was negatively associated with having mastitis (-0.30 kg/day). In interaction terms, taller cows had higher DMP than shorter cows, whereas heifers (first parity cows) had similar DMP regardless of height. Also, thin cows (2+ parity with body condition score {\textless} 2.5 out of 5) produced less milk (1.0 kg/day less) than cows with a better body condition score at calving,whereas thin heifers produced more milk (2.0 kg/day more) than heifers in better body condition-this association is possibly due to a small unrepresentative sample size of heifers. In conclusion, feeding DM in the month prior to calving, improving body condition in cows prior to calving, and enhancing dietary DM and high protein forage were positively associated with DMP in early lactation on Kenyan SDF. In addition there was an association between, taller cows and increased DMP, evidence supporting the importance of educating farmers on good genetic selection and heifer management. These findings will help with future management recommendations for higher DMP on SDF. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: There are many farmers in rural Ethiopia, who do not join cooperative societies, despite the different technical and financial supports from the government. This study thus aims to investigate the main factors that inspire rural people to join into the cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: The study collected relevant primary data from 400 sample households using a special household survey designed for this study. The study also reviewed different secondary materials. The collected data were analyzed using the two-sample t-test principle and cooperative participation probit model. Findings: The finding of the binary choice model illustrates that information access, special skill, membership in rural association, frequency of attending a public meeting/workshop, household head education, credit access, training access, number of family members in school, distance to main market, availability of infrastructures, farmland ownership and farmland sizes are the major explanatory variables that have statistically significant (p-value {\textless}0.05) influence on the rural people joining in the cooperative societies in the study areas. Research limitations/implications: This study was based on a cross-sectional survey. As a result, the finding may be subjected to some limitations though the study made all possible efforts to minimize the limitations. Practical implications: Many studies found that cooperatives are a basis for food security. Accordingly, the government can increase a number of cooperative societies in the region by giving more focus to knowledge- and awareness-based instruments like education, information center, rural associations, communication services and roads. These campaigns can attract more people to join the cooperatives and then get the different economic and social advantages from the cooperatives in order to ensure household food security. Originality/value: Some studies found that state, leadership, success history of the cooperative and autonomous status are the most important factors that determine not only the expansion of cooperatives in terms of a number of and types but also for the success of the cooperatives. This study, however, found the importance of information- and knowledge-based mechanisms as a basis to attract more people so that increase in a number of and types of the cooperative societies. Thus, the result of the study is significant for policy makers, social science students, researchers and cooperative societies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Smallholder tree plantations are seen as promising routes to alleviating poverty and increasing forest area among the countries in Southeast Asia. However, implementation has been disappointing, which led scientists at the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) to consider a scenario exercise as a way to mitigate the risk of unwanted outcomes. The study had a characteristic that it shares with many other studies: close interaction of larger-scale processes and trends (global markets, national policy) with smaller-scale systems (regional and local policy, farmer livelihoods). The authors therefore felt than an explicitly multi-scale approach was called for. To keep close to the well-known practice, we made a modest extension to a conventional scenario logic approach, and introduced a nested, and multi-scale scenario logic. While modest, we believe that the modification is useful, and the method could be used in other studies, in particular climate adaptation studies. We applied the method during two scenario workshops held to explore the use of smallholder tree plantations in efforts to improve rural livelihoods; each workshop considered two different localities. While the scenario frameworks resulting from the workshops were similar between the localities, we believe that the nested scenario framework served to structure the process and revealed meaningful contextual differences. From these experiences, we discuss and critique the method. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Presently, there are over two billion people globally affected by the scourge of hunger and poverty, most of them being in sub-Saharan Africa. The challenge is to ensure food and nutrition security for them, and one option is the promotion of goat farming. Goat genetic resources play an important socio-economic role in many rural parts of the world. Dairy goats occupy a unique and significant niche in resource-limited smallholder farming systems in the high potential areas of the tropics and subtropics due to their potential to greatly improve livelihoods largely through provision of milk for home consumption and surplus for sale to raise income. Besides, they supply meat, skins, fibre and manure, and play intangible roles like being insurance against emergencies and as an investment in stock. Consequently, numerous projects have adopted the use of dairy goats as an intervention strategy in improving the livelihood of the disadvantaged in various communities in eastern Africa. Community participation, breeding practices, comparative advantage, institutional aspects, extension services and environmental interactions are some of the suggested factors that can impact on the success to which most organizations need to note before embarking upon development initiatives that target the use of dairy goats.},

	abstract = {Context In Asia, losses to rodents contribute to the undernourishment of smallholder families. Ecologically based rodent management (EBRM) has become the national policy for rodent management in rice-based agriculture in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. EBRM requires community action. Therefore we need to develop communication campaigns that increase community involvement in rodent management. Aims This study evaluates the effects of a campaign to promote EBRM in a community that suffers chronic rodent losses to their rice crop. We hypothesised that the campaign would create changes in rodent management by farmers based on key messages delivered. Methods We documented existing beliefs and management practices, and captured changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of smallholder farmers after the campaign. We also document benefits to the community. We used qualitative tools to evaluate existing beliefs and management practices of rodents in nine villages in Zaragosa, one of which was a focus village for the campaign. Key results Farmers who were influenced by the campaign had significantly higher mean rank scores in knowledge and attitudes pertaining to key messages of the campaign, such as working together, proper timing of management actions, and that rodents can be controlled. Farmers who heard the campaign obtained yields that were higher by 0.7tha-1 compared with those with no exposure to the campaign. A year after the campaign, the increase in rice yield in Zaragosa was sufficient to feed 1375 adult Filipinos for a year. The campaign influenced policy on rodent management in Zaragosa and subsequently at the provincial level. Conclusions A media campaign with support from local leaders and extension staff is an effective way to disseminate EBRM, leading to positive economic benefits for smallholder farmers. A media campaign alone is less effective. Implications A communication campaign on EBRM with follow-up support from extension experts is a highly effective pathway for changing attitudes and practices of smallholder farmers on rodent management, and for effective dissemination of EBRM. © 2011 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {Agricultural engineering (AE) is one of the disciplines that have been adversely affected by declining enrolments and popularity among school leavers, especially in developed countries. Efforts to reverse the downward trend must consider curriculum changes, which broaden the currently narrow and shrinking sources and catchment areas of potential fresh student intakes, as well as providing them with skills for lifelong learning and employment opportunities beyond the agricultural sector. This article examines some of the current perceptions and trends in AE education, and proposes a global orientation to a curriculum that equips undergraduate students with integrative skills in applied sciences, engineering principles and emerging technologies. A triad of emerging technological innovations that are driving the knowledge economy is identified and recommended for inclusion in an AE educational curriculum. The new AE education paradigm will enable graduates and professionals to shift the historical emphasis from 'on-farm mechanization' to the development and application of new innovations to support knowledge-intensive and information-driven agriculture. Effective communication and dialogue with key stakeholders, and implementing adequate response to emerging technological, environmental and economic challenges facing agriculture are critical to winning public support and improving the appeal of AE among school leavers and industries. Strategies that include changing the current name of educational AE programmes and/or professional societies must be pursued with considerable caution if the profession is to remain truly global and to facilitate the international mobility of future agricultural engineers in an increasingly globalized labour market. The prospects for innovative engineering inputs for transforming smallholder agriculture in least developed countries are discussed.},

The strata were upper-midlands (UM) 1 zero-grazing, UM 1 open-grazing, UM 2 zero-grazing, UM 4 zero-grazing and UM 4 open-grazing. In total, 225 calves on 188 smallholder dairy farms were visited within the first 2 weeks of life and thereafter at biweekly intervals up to the age of 6 months between March 1995 and August 1996. During each visit, the calves were weighed and other calf-management practices in the farm during the visit such as housing, feeding and tick control also were recorded. Other events such as morbidity and mortality between or during the visits were also recorded. The overall mean daily weight gains were 0.24-0.29 kg (S. D. = 0.17-0.22 kg) and were lower than the recommended targets for smallholder farms of 0.40-0.50 kg. The major tendency in variability of daily weight gains was due to visit-to-visit variation (especially in calves {\textgreater}3 months old). Differences in mean daily gains were associated with AEZ-grazing strata and calf-level factors that included breed of calf, calf sickness, incidence of ECF, feeding of milk, concentrate feeds and minerals and interaction between calf age and AEZ-grazing strata (P {\textless} 0.05). ECF and other calf sicknesses exerted a temporal effect on calf-growth at the height of illness and immediately after; calves later recovered the lost growth except where other factors such as poor calf nutrition prevailed. Improvement in calf-growth in Murang'a District is achievable and extension services should continue to target individual-calf-level management practices. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This is particularly true in Africa where national efforts have been supplemented with international research institutes. Although some modest progress has been achieved in improving agricultural technology, on the whole, the improvement record is not quite encouraging among the small-scale farmers. In many areas, either there are no improved technologies, or where they exist, are unacceptable by farmers. However, where useful technologies exist, their spread has been very limited and where they have been adapted, the benefits only accrue to a small segment of the community. The logical question posed is: why and how do we find ourselves in the current situation? This paper considers the view that to understand fully why the available technologies have remained largely at the research centres, there is need to examine the whole process of research, development, dissemination and utilization of agricultural technology. It is significant to investigate the structural constraints and prospects under which those involved in the process work, their motivations and the interactions between different groups. The traditional 'top-down' of development strategy should be supplemented with farmers' indigenous knowledge, and programmes encouraging transfer of agricultural technology should include institutional support. Only by the identification of farmers' environmental and resource utilisation, preferences, socio-economic circumstances and constraints can a development programme of optimum meaning to farmers be devised and implemented with success.},

This approach is not always effective and has proved hard to scale sustainably, particularly in highly dispersed smallholder farming systems. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been advanced as a promising way to overcome many of the problems associated with conventional agricultural extension. We evaluate the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated approach to deliver agricultural information in a field experiment conducted among small-scale maize farmers in eastern Uganda. Three complementary technologies designed to address both informational and behavioral constraints to technical change are considered. First, we investigate the effectiveness of audiovisual messages (video) as a means of delivering information on input use and improved maize management practices to farmers. Second, we quantify the additional impact of complementing video with an interactive voice response (IVR) service. Third, we estimate the incremental effect of time-sensitive short message services (SMS) messages designed to remind farmers about applying key practices at specific points during the season. We find that households that were shown a short video on how to become better maize farmers were performing significantly better on a knowledge test, more likely to apply recommended practices, and more likely to use fertilizer than households that did not view the video. These same households also reported maize yields about 10.5\% higher than those that did not view the video. We find little evidence of an incremental effect of the IVR service or SMS reminders. © 2020 The Authors.

Here, we present results of a three-year study in on-farm and on-station trials of Zimbabwe. We tested sole cropping compared to intercropping with different grain legumes and green manures as well as fertilizer application (in the case of on-station trials) on associated crop yields, total system yield, and yield stability. As methods, we used mixed modelling, best linear unbiased predictors estimation and additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analysis to analyse the data. The results show that intercropping systems with the selected legumes resulted in yield penalties. However, on-station sites showed maize/pigeonpea intercropping to be comparable to the sole maize in maize grain and biomass yield and to be superior in total system yield (108 GJ ha−1 vs. 74 GJ ha−1). Comparison of intercropping against sole cropping revealed that sole maize out-yielded all intercropping strategies in all environments on-farm while the maize/pigeon intercropping strategy out-yielded sole maize in almost all environments on-station. In general, total system yield of intercrops out-yielded sole maize in most environments signifying the ability of intercrops to enhance cropping system yields. Stability analysis on-farm showed that intercropping with cowpea and jack bean was more stable compared to sole maize as a result of better systems performance across the environments. On-station, the maize/pigeonpea intercropping strategy was in general the most stable. We conclude that intercropping is a viable option for smallholder farmers. However, there is need to investigate other crop arrangements to reduce competition for both maize and the intercrop and double-row strip cropping may be an option. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In 2016, a study was conducted in Tanzania to assess the impact of radio and SMS in scaling-up smallholder participation in legume-based sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) practices and technologies. The study aimed to answer the following research questions: (i) does participation in the campaign enhance farmers’ knowledge of legume-based sustainable agricultural intensification practices and technologies? (ii) what is the impact of the campaign on the adoption of legume-based sustainable agricultural intensification practices and technologies?; (iii) does exposure to multiple ICT-enabled channels result in larger gains (in terms of knowledge and adoption) than exposure to only one channel? (iv) is it more cost-effective to use radio or SMS alone or use them in combination? The results show that both awareness and adoption are boosted if SMS supports radio campaigns. However, radio alone is the most cost-effective approach. Each dollar spent on the radio campaign results in 2.1 farmers that have adopted at least one new practice, compared with 0.5 farmers for SMS and 0.4 farmers for radio and SMS combined. Other factors were also important in facilitating uptake of legume-based SAI practices, such as gender, age, education and land size, but were not statistically significant when rated against the communication channels used. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in the potential of agroforestry to improve the productivity and sustainability of coffee production, but designing management options is knowledge intensive. Tree-crop interactions and the biophysical and socio-economic factors influencing farmers’ decision-making about companion trees are complex and context-specific but fine scale data relating to them are rarely available. A novel method was used to analyse trees ranked by farmers for a range of attributes and evaluate the consistency of farmers’ knowledge underpinning decisions about tree management in coffee production systems in Rwanda. Farmers’ knowledge about tree planting was changing, in line with new shade management recommendations being promoted alongside a limited number of tree species, often freely distributed through eco-certification initiatives. Farmers had detailed knowledge about soil and water conservation processes associated with trees, but they traded these off against perceived competition for light, water and nutrients with coffee. The competitiveness of trees with coffee was influenced by combinations of attributes related to: crown architecture, foliage properties and growth patterns; as well as how trees responded to management, and, their utility. Farmers consistently ranked 20 tree species for 12 attributes (five related to ecology, four to management and three to utility). Given the paucity of data on tree attributes for many species, systematically acquired and consistent local knowledge complements global scientific information and can be useful in bridging knowledge gaps relating to the integration of tree diversity in coffee production systems, which is an increasingly important strategy for smallholder farmers adapting to climate change. © 2018, The Author(s).},

The research approaches taken by these systems explicitly or implicitly seek simple, one-size-fits-all solutions for problems and opportunities that are extremely diverse. Radical change is needed to facilitate the agroecological intensification of smallholder farming. We propose that large-scale participatory approaches, combined with innovations in information and communications technology (ICT), could enable the effective matching of diverse options to the wide spectrum of socio-ecological context that characterize smallholder agriculture. We consider the requirements, precedents and issues that might be involved in the development of farmer research networks (FRNs). Substantial institutional innovation will be needed to support FRNs, with shifts in roles and relationships amongst researchers, extension providers and farmers. Where farmers' organizations have social capital and strong facilitation skills, such alignments may be most feasible. Novel information management capabilities will be required to introduce options and principles, enable characterization of contexts, manage data related to option-by-context interactions and enable farmers to visualize their findings in useful and intelligible ways. FRNs could lead to vastly greater capacity for technical innovation, which could in turn enable greater productivity and resilience, and enhance the quality of rural life. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {The major concern of most African countries, including Nigeria, in recent times is how to increase food production because of food insecurity issues, which by extension, is a major contributing factor to the prevalence of poverty. Therefore, adoption of conservation agricultural practices is regarded as a pathway to drive the achievement of food and nutrition security, as well as the needed optimal performance in the agri-food sector. Reportedly, scaling up of the limited adoption of these practices could be facilitated through kinship ties, peer influence, and social networks that govern mutual interactions among individuals; therefore, this motivated the study. Using cross-sectional data obtained from 350 sample units selected from South-Western Nigeria through a multistage sampling technique, this study applied descriptive statistical tools and cross-tabulation techniques to profile the sampled subjects while count outcome models were used to investigate the factors driving counts of conservative agriculture (CA) adoption. Similarly, a marginal treatment effects (MTEs) model (parametric approach) using local IV estimator was applied to examine the effects of CA adoption on the outcome (log of farmers' farm income). Additionally, appropriate measures of fit tests statistics were used to test the reliabilities of the fitted models. Findings revealed that farmers' years of farming experience (p {\textless} 0.1), frequency of extension visits (p {\textless} 0.05), and social capital viz-a-viz density of social group memberships (p {\textless} 0.05) significantly determined the count of CA practices adopted with varying degrees by smallholder farmers. Although, social capital expressed in terms of membership of occupational group and diversity of social group members also had a positive influence on the count of CA practices adopted but not significant owing largely to the "information gaps" about agricultural technologies in the study area. However, the statistical tests of the MTEs indicated that the treatment effects differed significantly across the covariates and it also varied significantly with unobserved heterogeneity. The policy relevant treatment effect estimates also revealed that different policy scenarios could increase or decrease CA adoption, depending on which individuals it induces to attract the expected spread and exposure. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study assesses the effectiveness of climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) practices in terms of cost–benefits, and prioritizes the activities involved. It was carried out in the Udayapur district of Nepal, where the application of CRA practices into vegetable farming has introduced jholmol (a bio-pesticide and nutrient supplement); water conservation technologies; support for formation of farmers’ groups; regular technical follow-up; and flow of regular market information through short message services (SMS: that is, text messaging). This study is based on the discussions of five focus groups held with local farmers, and on 300 interviews with participating households in the study area. The results indicate that CRA generates multiple benefits compared to conventional agricultural practices. For instance, the benefit–cost ratio (BCR) of CRA practice is 1.81 as compared to 1.02 for conventional farming. In addition, practicing CRA has changed the food habits of farmers, since the proportion of vegetables consumed in their regular meals has increased substantially. Farmers are also engaging in vegetable farming in their leisure time, instead of drifting around their villages. However, CRA practice demands capital NPR. 537,695/ha/year (USD 5220/ha/year) as compared to conventional agricultural practice NPR. 140,171/ha/year (USD 1361/ha/year). Formation of the farmers’ group probably promoted dissemination of knowledge on CRA practices, as it facilitated interaction and the exchange of ideas. CRA is, therefore, an integrated approach rather than the simple provision of technology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive research focused on increasing the sustainability and productivity of agricultural systems in the tropics, adoption rates of improved management solutions often remain low among smallholder farmers. To address this, we evaluated how local knowledge and perceptions influenced decision-making processes among smallholder cocoa farmers. We conducted individual semistructured interviews with 72 cocoa farmers in Southeast Sulawesi and documented local knowledge about soil fertility indicators, nutrient cycling processes, and the interactions among shade trees, cocoa trees, and soils in cocoa agroforests. We further collected data regarding farmers’ fertilizer preferences, additional income sources, and perceived barriers to improved cocoa production. We found that farmers’ understanding of biophysical interactions in Southeast Sulawesi was comprehensive, mostly accurately aligned with scientific literature, and sometimes provided additional complementary knowledge. Cocoa farmers in Southeast Sulawesi approached decision making in a holistic way, integrating personal observations, information from external sources, and socioeconomic limitations and priorities. This finding highlights the value of flexible conservation farming approaches that allow farmers to minimize trade-offs and prioritize their households’ needs. Finally, we identify a “dual” knowledge gap on the part of farmers and scientists regarding the direct benefits of shade tree inclusion for improved yields and income security. Addressing this through further research and targeted knowledge dissemination could contribute to an increase in the long-term adoption rates of more sustainable cocoa cultivation practices. © 2018 by the author(s).},

Despite the fact that extension practitioners face many problems in this area of their work, there is currently a lack of academic literature that systematically addresses the topic and offers concrete guidelines for practice. Thus, this paper will aim to clarify the benefits of farmers' groups, associations and networks within the context of family farming, systematise problems faced by rural extensionists when working with farmers' groups and associations, provide conceptual tools for understanding group and associative processes, and construct a set of guidelines and recommendations for facing said problems. In order to achieve these aims, the authors conducted an extensive literature review and drew upon their personal experience on the topic. Results suggest that some of the benefits of associative work are: better access to inputs, produce and credit markets, the facilitation of learning processes, the empowerment of family farmers as social actors, and a reduction of rural extension costs. Additionally, with respects to the problems faced by extensionists, the following can be highlighted: individualist attitudes and conflicts between farmers, scarce participation and commitment, problems with leaderships and with organisations' administrative management, and the lack of extensionists' training to address these processes, among others. With regards to the factors that increase trust and cooperation are: interpersonal communication and mutual knowledge, sharing problems, values and objectives, and the existence of shared rules for the functioning of the group that include sanctions for transgressors. In this context, the extensionists' role will be that of facilitating processes of construction of group relationships, creating rules for the groups' functioning and developing the group's capacities for self-management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Results suggest that rule convergence in export (formal) and domestic (informal) agricultural production systems displaced informal institutions to a lower position in the institutional hierarchy. This institutional change has reduced interactions between farming community members, with negative implications for bonding and bridging social capital in the domestic food production system. Collectively, these changes have resulted in unintended outcomes associated with the decline of many rural communities. Our findings highlight the need to better identify bridging institutions in Saint Lucia's domestic agri-food sector that could help support shared rule-making, the decentralization of power and reciprocal knowledge flows amongst policy actors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Over the past four decades, advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have resulted in unprecedented opportunity and innovation for improving farming outcomes. Ongoing innovations such as mobile, social media, agricultural drones, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and cloud computing presented new challenges and opportunities for agribusinesses to redefine and rethink the role of ICT towards achieving better farming outcomes. With recent advances in infrastructure, data (collection, storage and retrieval), and a better understanding of all aspects of the food chain, new challenges and opportunities are presented. Unstructured data is now being generated real time, in large volumes, at high speed and unknown quality that results in challenges to current approaches for decision making, and requires a focus on analytics. These new sources of data create the opportunity to inform and drive a change in decision making from one that is highly intuitive to one that is data driven and processed in real-time. This paper highlights recent trends in ICT and introduces hybrid cloud architecture for smart farming. The proposed architecture emphasizes data-driven, farmer-centered, and knowledge-based decision tools through service integration, aggregation and interoperation. As a customized solution for farmers, the proposed architecture contains components of 1) data integration of on-farm sensors and data from public sources, 2) farm management modules, 3) knowledge-based software solutions from different providers, 4) service integration, aggregation and interoperation, and 5) a customized dashboard focused on usefulness and usability. This cloud-based solution allows the integration of businesses services, things, and technology from any channel and can be used anywhere. At this time, hybrid cloud environments have shown promise to integrate these different services and provide smart farming solutions to both big and smallholder farmers. © 2016, Int.

	abstract = {We evaluated farmers’ rationales to understand their decision making in relation to the use of fertile anthropogenic soils, i.e., Amazonian dark earths (ADE), and for dealing with changes in shifting cultivation in Central Amazonia. We analyzed qualitative information from 196 interviews with farmers in 21 riverine villages along the Madeira River. In order to decide about crop management options to attain their livelihood objectives, farmers rely on an integrated and dynamic understanding of their biophysical and social environment. Farmers associate fallow development with higher crop yields and lower weed pressure, but ADE is always associated with high yields and high weeding requirements. Amazonian dark earths are also seen as an opportunity to grow different crops and/or grow crops in more intensified management systems. However, farmers often maintain simultaneously intensive swiddens on ADE and extensive swiddens on nonanthropogenic soils. Farmers acknowledge numerous changes in their socioeconomic environment that affect their shifting cultivation systems, particularly their growing interaction with market economies and the incorporation of modern agricultural practices. Farmers considered that shifting cultivation systems on ADE tend to be more prone to changes leading to intensification, and we identified cases, e.g., swiddens used for watermelon cultivation, in which market demand led to overintensification and resulted in ADE degradation. This shows that increasing intensification can be a potential threat to ADE and can undermine the importance of these soils for agricultural production, for the conservation of agrobiodiversity, and for local livelihoods. Given that farmers have an integrated knowledge of their context and respond to socioeconomic and agro-ecological changes in their environment, we argue that understanding farmers’ knowledge and rationales is crucial to identify sustainable pathways for the future of ADE and of smallholder agriculture in Amazonia. © 2016 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: The recent avian influenza epidemic in Asia and the H1N1 pandemic demonstrated that influenza A viruses pose a threat to global public health. The animal origins of the viruses confirmed the potential for interspecies transmission. Swine are hypothesized to be prime "mixing vessels" due to the dual receptivity of their trachea to human and avian strains. Additionally, avian and human influenza viruses have previously been isolated in swine. Therefore, understanding interspecies contact on smallholder swine farms and its potential role in the transmission of pathogens such as influenza virus is very important.Methods: This qualitative study aimed to determine swine-associated interspecies contacts in two coastal areas of Peru. Direct observations were conducted at both small-scale confined and low-investment swine farms (n = 36) and in open areas where swine freely range during the day (n = 4). Interviews were also conducted with key stakeholders in swine farming.Results: In both locations, the intermingling of swine and domestic birds was common. An unexpected contact with avian species was that swine were fed poultry mortality in 6/20 of the farms in Chancay. Human-swine contacts were common, with a higher frequency on the confined farms. Mixed farming of swine with chickens or ducks was observed in 36\% of all farms. Human-avian interactions were less frequent overall. Use of adequate biosecurity and hygiene practices by farmers was suboptimal at both locations.Conclusions: Close human-animal interaction, frequent interspecies contacts and suboptimal biosecurity and hygiene practices pose significant risks of interspecies influenza virus transmission. Farmers in small-scale swine production systems constitute a high-risk population and need to be recognized as key in preventing interspecies pathogen transfer. A two-pronged prevention approach, which offers educational activities for swine farmers about sound hygiene and biosecurity practices and guidelines and education for poultry farmers about alternative approaches for processing poultry mortality, is recommended. Virological and serological surveillance for influenza viruses will also be critical for these human and animal populations. © 2012 McCune et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, prompted by shifts in international thinking about natural resources management, by donor conditionalities, and by fiscal crises, many developing countries have instituted sweeping reforms of their water management regimes. Most of the reforms generally focus on management of blue water while excluding green water. On the other hand, agricultural policy is generally focused on modernization of agriculture through extension services at the farm level. Small-holder system innovations (SSIs) and the interactions between water for food and ecosystem services are not properly addressed in terms of their policy and institutional dimensions. Using case studies from the Thukela and Pangani river basins, this paper demonstrates the importance of SSIs in improving food production. It traces the history of the SSIs and the institutional configurations arising therefrom. Preliminary evidence from the research being carried out in the two basins indicates that when rainfall is inadequate or unreliable and water shortages limit crop production, the uptake of resource conserving technologies can bring about sustainable agriculture for local communities. The challenge is to find ways in which these can spread beyond their small localities and reach other communities. The paper focuses on institutional arrangements, support systems and policy requirements at different scales that can enhance adoption of SSIs. The SSIs include rainwater harvesting and conservation farming. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A land-use system (LUS) model was formulated to represent the economic returns derived from shaded cacao production practiced by smallholders in the Toledo district of Belize. Sixty scenarios were tested to elicit response of net-present-value (NPV), returns to labor, and annual returns to land (ARTL) to individual changes in 10 system parameters. Further scenarios tested the combined interactions between hardwood shade tree type, planting density, time to harvest hardwoods, cacao cultivation practice, and expected output. As a modeling exercise, LUS analysis highlights system components that government agencies, donors, NGOs, extension agents, and smallholders should target with policies, agri-silvi- culture projects, and further research. Results identify more favorable credit, labor-saving technology, better shade-management practices, grafting, and incorporating non-hardwood shade trees and laurel (Cordia alliadora) as interventions that could improve cacao financial performance and encourage adoption. At present, the model cannot predict whether smallholders would respond to recommendations and invest in shaded cacao cultivation in lieu of alternative agricultural land-uses or off-farm employment. © Springer 2005.},

	abstract = {Concentrates are the main cash expenditure in smallholder campesino dairying in the highlands of Central Mexico. Improved, low-cost, appropriate feeding strategies have been therefore identified by campesinos as a priority. An on-farm trial was undertaken in 1998 to evaluate the response to supplementation with concentrates by dairy cows in early lactation during the rainy season with restricted access to grazing of ryegrass/white clover pastures. A base of 3.0 kg commercial concentrate/cow/day (S3) was compared against the higher rate used by farmers of 5.0 kg/cow/day (S5). Three farmers with one, and one farmer with two pairs of freshly calved upgraded Holstein cows participated in the trial (24 ± 10.7 days into lactation). Data were analysed by a random block split-plot design where supplementation treatments were main plots and measurement periods were split-plots. Milk yield was recorded once per week for 9 weeks, and live weight and condition score for four 28 day periods. Milk yields were 21.8 for S3 and 21.9 for S5 (± 0.714) kg milk/day/cow (P {\textgreater} 0.05); live weight S3 = 444.0 and S5 = 496.0 (± 12.663) kg/cow (P {\textgreater} 0.05), and condition score S3 = 1.9, and S5 = 1.8 (± 1.127) (P {\textgreater} 0.05). There were no significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) effects of measurement periods, and there was no significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) interaction. The lack of response in milk yield, live weight or condition score to increased concentrate supplementation demonstrates that at these levels of production and management, the access to grazing of improved pastures, plus limited concentrate, enables cows in campesino systems to meet their nutrient requirements, and the feasibility of efficient milk production from grazed pastures as an appropriate technology. It is also concluded that it is an appropriate technology and that the results have implications for research and extension workers in rural development who have promoted large amounts of concentrate to dairy cows as the only way towards high yields and efficient milk production.},

Several machine learning approaches were used in this study to investigate the relative influences of multiple biophysical, socio-economic, and crop management features in determining maize yield variability using several machine learning approaches. Soil fertility status was assessed in 180 farms and paired with the surveyed data on maize yield, socio-economic conditions, and agronomic management. The C\&RT relative variable importance plot identified farm size, total labor, soil factors, seed rate, fertilizer, and organic manure as influential factors. Among the three approaches compared for classifying maize yield, the artificial neural network (ANN) yielded the least (25\%) misclassification on validation samples. The random forest partial dependence plots revealed a positive association between farm size and maize productivity. Nonlinear support vector machine boundary analysis for the eight top important variables revealed complex interactions underpinning maize yield response. Notably, farm size and total labor synergistically increased maize yield. Future research integrating these algorithms with empirical crop growth models and crop simulation models for ex-ante yield estimations could result in further improvement. © 2020 Dutta et al.

The way food and nutrition security problems and solutions are understood by decision makers and researchers inevitably influences interventions in food systems. One novel way of capturing different and potentially competing understandings of food and nutrition security problems and solutions is transdisciplinary research. In this paper, we examine how Southeast Asian policy and research experts working in food and nutrition security frame challenges and solutions, and the implications of this understanding for their capacity to adopt initiatives from emerging transdisciplinary research in the region. We conducted a workshop with research and policy experts from four countries in Southeast Asia and used a systems based human ecology framework to capture the common understanding participants have of the main challenges in their food systems. The systems exercises revealed similarities in the dominant framing presented by researchers and policy makers, and of the respective agencies of key stakeholders. We found that formal government policy and training was commonly perceived as major drivers of change, with smallholder farmers viewed as passive recipients of knowledge. We also found there is ongoing interest in increasing productivity of key commodities, but there is critical awareness of the environmental consequences of production-oriented agriculture. These dominant understandings have implications for current regional initiatives in transdisciplinary research that seek to build farmer capacity, reduce inequality, and include different stakeholders in research and policy activities. We conclude by arguing that research agencies aspiring to inform policy interventions based on transdisciplinary processes will face challenges given the current dominant frames of food systems in the region. We show how human ecology and systems frameworks can guide transdisciplinary food systems research that aims to improve food and nutrition security. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A transdisciplinary research approach requires that different scientists with their discipline-specific theories, concepts and methods find ways to work together with other societal players to address a real-life problem. In this study, the push-pull technology (PPT) was used as a boundary object to enable interactions among stakeholders across science-practice boundaries engaged in the control of stemborer pest in maize crops in Bako Tibe, Jimma Arjo and YayuWoredas in Ethiopia between August 2014 and April 2015. The PPT is a biological mechanism developed by researchers for the control of stemborer pests and Striga weed in maize crop. It involves inter-cropping maize with a stemborer moth-repellent silverleaf or greenleaf Desmodium (push), and planting an attractive trap crop, Napier or Brachiaria grass (pull), around it. The on-farm implementation of PPT was used to provide an opportunity for collaboration, interaction and learning among stakeholders including researchers from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research and practitioners from the Ministry of Agriculture and smallholder farmers/traders. The researchwas implemented following the transdisciplinary action research and the data collected using mixed methods approach, including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, workshops, on-farm practical demonstrations and participant observations. The findings show that collaborative leadership provides a chance for the stakeholders to participate in the technology learning and decision making, by enabling them to jointly contribute skills towards development, refinement and adaptation of the PPT. In situations where there are conflicts, they are embraced and converted to opportunities for in-depth learning, finding solutions and adaptation of the innovation processes rather than being sources of contradictions or misunderstandings. The leadership roles of the farmers enabled them to reflect on their own practices and draw on scientific explanations from researchers. It also enabled them to take the lead in new technology implementation and information sharing with fellow farmers and other stakeholders in a free and easy manner. Although the perennial nature of the companion crops in the PPT provides opportunities for continuous stakeholder interaction and learning, it requires a personally committed leadership and formal institutional engagements for the sustainability of the activities, which span several cropping seasons. Market forces and the involvement of the private sector also play a role as shown from the involvement of individual farmers and traders in Desmodium and Brachiaria seed production, collection and distribution during the PPT implementation. © 2018 by the authors.},

The 16 workshops inspired on the theory of the Pedagogy of the Oppressed, involved a total of 270 participants across the four case studies in remote Tanzanian villages. The results show that community voices and local problem perceptions significantly differed between the case study regions, which had a strong impact on coping strategies and nutritional status. In Morogoro, e.g., food insecurity was mainly related to conflicts. Smallholders with anemia prefer to avoid meat and milk as these products come from livestock keepers who have destroyed their crop farm production. More than 70 local diverse solutions were identified. The acceptance of the educational tools used was highly appreciated at local level compared to more conventional procedures (e.g. questionnaires). The pedagogical methods applied in this work served to raise the communities’ voices, to promote consciences about communities’ problems, and reframing their images of the future.

But in order to successfully use mobile phones for the optimal development of agricultural markets, understanding the impact of social structure on mobile phone adoption, its uses and perceived impacts are invaluable. Although global assessments of capacity in the use of information communication technology (ICT) devices have been considered, such assessments mask significant geo-spatial variations among local farmers—male and female—with respect to their capacity to effectively use basic mobile phone functions. Documenting and recognizing this is important for the development of national agricultural ICT policies, as well as programmes aimed at increasing farmers’ knowledge and use of ICT for agricultural marketing. This article’s contribution to agricultural marketing and the use of ICT in developing countries (such as Ghana) is anchored in the assessment of the technical capacity and mobile telephone-based market information access to farmers in selected rural districts of Ghana.

In this study, we use a hybrid epistemological framework that integrates scientifc and local knowledge systems, methodological approaches, and geographic scopes to: 1) shed light on climate change in the equatorial Andes as reported by scientific and local knowledge systems, and 2) understand the role that climate factors play on land use and agricultural change in natural resource dependent communities in the region. We analyzed weather station (n = 5) data and downscaled climate data using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, and spatial analysis techniques to detect spatio-temporal climate trends between 1965 and 2013. We also analyzed climate variability in the past four decades using qualitative information derived from a semi-structured survey (n = 36) and life history smallholder interviews (n = 8) collected in three research sites. Our study reveals significant warming trends in the region which is corroborated by local reports. Precipitation records show high inter-annual variability, with no significant decreasing or increasing trends, which contradicts people's views in two of our research sites. Our study shows that although climate change appears to be a factor that influences farmers’ agricultural and livestock-production practices, other non-climatic forces play a more important role in determining their intensity and adoption. Despite site-level divergences and convergences, scientific and local knowledge systems can be woven together to expand our understanding of the physical and human manifestations of climate change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Given the complexity of farming systems, farmer differences and the involvement of different stakeholders, as well as the expectations of research funders, what contributions can be made by different interest groups to the construction of an actionable research agenda that produces locally relevant yet original, empirical and transferable findings? In a case study of smallholder irrigation in South Africa, we analyze how, using a transdisciplinary approach, a balance can be struck between the priorities of different stakeholders in defining a research agenda. A transdisciplinary approach was interpreted to entail full participation of diverse stakeholders and integration of different issues as key features. Stakeholder participation was mediated through formal platforms: the Learning and Practice Alliance (LPA) and the Community of Practice (CoP). Farmers and local extension workers participated through the CoP, while other stakeholders, including the public and private sector participated through the LPA. A five step participatory process aimed at allowing stakeholders to fully understand issues, contribute to and validate the research agenda was followed, utilizing a combination of methods, including field observation, photography and discussion. We observed that farmer and researcher participation occurred along two main continua, which we define as a 'participation matrix' - one continuum relating to the contribution of knowledge and information, and the other to decision making. The participation matrix can be used as a reference framework for guiding the transdisciplinary definition of research agendas, to aid in balancing knowledge and priorities including local relevance, ownership, originality, and transferability of findings.

Due to its simplicity, the static simulation tool of annual farm stocks and flows led to superior changes in the farmers' knowledge and practices. The rule-based dynamic simulation tool helped the researchers grasp farmers' decision-making processes but was difficult for farmers to understand due to the discrepancy between its multi-annual time step and the farmers' short-term planning horizon. The optimisation tool stimulated more strategic discussions regarding paths to improve farm income despite a design that was distant from the farmers' reality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper reports on the development of a participatory methodology to systematize long-term experimentation with agroforestry systems carried out in a hotspot of biodiversity by non-governmental organizations and local farmers. A methodological guide for systematization and techniques used for Participatory Rural Appraisal formed the basis of our work. We propose an analytical framework that recognizes systems of reflexive and learning interactions, in order to make the learned lessons explicit. At the process level, the main lessons and recommendations are as follows. It is important to establish partnerships to conduct innovative and complex experimentation with agroforest. Participatory systematization allows us to improve the methodological aspects of design, implementation and management of on-farm participatory experimentation. It also serves to synthesize the main findings and to extract lessons from agroforestry systems experiments. It fosters the technical improvement of agroforestry systems. It creates possibilities for reflection on agroforestry systems by farmers, extensionists and researchers, as well as their learning with respect to management of such systems. The findings are placed in the context of current theory on participatory experimentation in agriculture. Extractive and interactive approaches help to produce rich insights of mutual interest through collaboration by identifying local, regional and global convergences, complementarities, and conflicts of interest; which affect the advance of new eco-friendly technologies, to both improve the livelihoods and to reverse biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The conventional concept of strategy as a 'plan' is contrasted with the use of strategy as a game, as a performance, and as an accident. This pluralistic view is echoed in recent literature on business strategy. A typology is developed that relates farmers' choice of IPM strategy to the predictability of crop losses, the stability of the crop environment, and farmers' knowledge of pests. Some implications for IPM are explored. Where conditions favour 'adaptive' rather than planned IPM strategies, formal experimentation to verify farmers' strategies may be an inefficient use of resources. Where the crop environment is volatile and several pests attack the crop simultaneously, there may be limited scope to increase the adoption of IPM strategies by improving farmer knowledge of pest biology. Addressing the interactions between pest and crop management is critical in making IPM relevant for resource-poor farmers. A deeper understanding of farmers' management strategies is required to frame meaningful recommendations.},

The adaptation of extensive or intensive farming practices, viable sizes of farming units, and unrealistic expectations reflected in high land prices, created problems. Following a learning process, it is clear that attention to marketing opportunities, managerial ability and access to capital must be stressed. These factors must definitely be incorporated in current reform initiatives for land settlement. In the case of small-scale irrigation farming, priority must be given to improved utilization of existing schemes, preceded by feasibility studies and accompanied by investment in human capital.

	abstract = {Background: In Africa, intensified pig production is frequently accompanied by increased occurrence of African swine fever (ASF) outbreaks, leading to high case fatality rates and socio-economic impact for the farmers. ASF control relies on prevention of disease transmission and control of outbreaks. The aim of this study was to increase the understanding on how the knowledge of ASF epidemiology and control can be transferred into successfully implemented biosecurity interventions on farm and community level. Structured interviews with 200 randomly selected, pig-keeping households in northern Uganda were undertaken three times. Perceptions related to general biosecurity and hypothetical control interventions and attitudes towards pig farming were investigated by measuring the agreement to statements using a Likert scale. Results: Respondents generally conveyed positivism towards pig farming, biosecurity, and the potential of biosecurity for preventing ASF outbreaks. These positive attitudes, as well as the will to invest in biosecurity, were reduced in households that had experienced ASF outbreaks. Among the control interventions change of boots before entering the pig stable was highly accepted and seasonal adaptation of pig rearing times accepted on medium level. Statements on preventive sales of healthy pigs in connection with outbreaks and on buying pork products from slaughter operations receiving ASF-contact pigs received low acceptance, increasing, however, for households that had experienced ASF outbreaks. Consumption of pork from ASF infected pigs was generally not accepted, medium level of agreement was expressed for statements on the zoonotic potential of ASF and for neutralizing ASF by cooking. Conclusions: To gain in-depth understanding of the complexity of people's behaviour, reasoning and decision-making processes, deeper involvement of the social sciences and a qualitative research approach might be used for further studies. Communicating information regarding the ASF not being zoonotic, and how the virus is neutralized will be important for increasing acceptance and enhancing implementation for the hypothetical control interventions preventive sales, safe slaughter, and consumption of processed and safe pork. Likewise, participatory development to adopt any control interventions to the local context on community level will be necessary for successful implementation. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Unequal reach and access to information is an issue that affects women involved in agricultural activities around the world. Recent initiatives to address gender unequal access to agricultural information have been clumsy, overlooking participatory approaches that focus on transformative change. This study uses Pakistani rural advisory services to compare farmers' and extension workers’ perceptions of access to agricultural information, to identify culturally acceptable gender-responsive schemes. Design/methodology/approach: One-hundred and eleven extension workers in Pakistan’s public rural advisory services were interviewed and crosstabulated with farmers’ answers in previous studies. Findings: Male extension workers are aware that women access less information less often; however they might not be aware of its importance in the gender inequality debate. Lead farmers could offer a potentially transformative knowledge pathway because of its blend of formal and informal interactions–both systems favoured by female smallholders. An exclusively female-led lead farmer approach could be developed and trialled in specific areas of the province. Practical implications: Targeted initiatives focusing on improving awareness and importance of gender inequalities in information access as well as specific extension system development centred on lead female farmers and extension agents are important in institutionalising gender and creating transformative change. Theoretical implications: Linking these activities to in-depth social network and agricultural innovation system analyses would provide further evidence of the importance of focused gender activities and their impact on food security. Originality/value: This paper highlights the importance of analysing individual perceptions to understand the types of initiatives that could be considered for a wider institutionalisation of gender in RAS. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

To improve this situation, an in-depth understanding of the importance of gender-responsive extension delivery is required. A case study of the Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement Program that put in extra efforts to reach more female farmers with extension delivery and other rural advisory services was conducted. The study investigates how gender dynamics interact with the agricultural extension delivery with particular reference to the adoption of improved technologies. A total sample of 592 smallholder farmers were interviewed in selected communities in Northern Ghana. In addition to one-on-one interviews, 18 focus group discussions were also conducted in the surveyed districts. Study findings confirmed that male farmers had more access to agricultural extension delivery than their female counterparts because of their relatively better financial standing, large farm sizes, mobility to access extension and rural advisory service providers outside their communities. The study identified gendered associations with some crop types across all the study districts. However, the gendered extension delivery led to a new sociocultural order that seems to break down the gendered associations with the adoption of improved technologies. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Current approaches to geographic information dissemination to smallholders, such as the rural extension model, are limited, yet advancements in internet and communication technologies (ICTs) could help augment these processes through the provision of agricultural geographic information (AGI) directly to farmers. We analysed recent ICT initiatives for communicating climate and agriculture-related information to smallholders for improved livelihoods and climate change adaptation. Through the critical analysis of initiatives, we identified opportunities for the success of future AGI developments. We systematically examined 27 AGI initiatives reported in academic and grey literature (e.g., organisational databases). Important factors identified for the success of initiatives include affordability, language(s), community partnerships, user collaboration, high quality and locally-relevant information through low-tech platforms, organisational trust, clear business models, and adaptability. We propose initiatives should be better-targeted to deliver AGI to regions in most need of climate adaptation assistance, including SE Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Further assessment of the most effective technological approaches is needed. Initiatives should be independently assessed for evaluation of their uptake and success, and local communities should be better-incorporated into the development of AGI initiatives. © 2018 by the authors.},

However, this ability is dependent on their knowledge and perceptions regarding lameness. To date these topics are poorly understood in all dairy systems. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a qualitative approach to describe the perception of lameness in Brazilian pasture-based dairy farms. The aim of this study was firstly, to contextualize farmers and dairy consultants’ culture and knowledge on the topic of lameness and, secondly, to understand how these factors may influence lameness management on the farms. In-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews were done with participating farm owners (n = 21) and dairy consultants (n = 13). Thematic analyses of the interview content provided evidence that the dairy community's overarching culture around lameness acts as a barrier preventing positive actions targeting lameness control and prevention. The emerging themes identified indicate that lameness is a vague, ill-defined concept among both farmers and dairy consultants working in this region. There was a shared belief that pasture-based systems have a low risk for lameness. Furthermore, the prevailing culture for tackling lameness was reactive, particularly in the case of lame cows affected by physical trauma or environmental factors. Treatment was frequently delayed and the misuse of antibiotics was evident. Described community culture was rationalised via the cognitive dissonance and health belief models. We suggest that increased dialogue, including educational efforts within the community, may lead to increased sensitivity of risk perception of lameness within the community and in turn trigger appropriate diagnosis and treatment of lame cows. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Universities are among the institutions with the responsibility to build up these competences. Universities are criticized though for focusing on academic and research roles with minimal impact on communities. Makerere University, Kampala, in response piloted a farmer entrepreneurship training project in a bid to effectively contribute to social transformation. The study assessed the influence of the training on smallholder farmers’ competences, productivity and organizational capacity. Data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions with 184 farmers in the project and non-project farmers in northern Uganda. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using SPSS computer package and thematic content analysis, respectively. A multiple regression analysis using the ordinary least square was used to capture the combined influence of entrepreneurship training and other socioeconomic variables on the farmers’ productivity. Our study findings show that the training had positively influenced farmers’ entrepreneurial and organizational competences. Farmers acquired improved agronomic practices, business planning, value addition and packaging, branding and marketing knowledge and skills. Group leadership, accountability, communication, networking and marketing competencies of the farmers were strengthened. The project demonstrated a possible framework for developing country university efforts to impact on sustainable agricultural development. Integrating entrepreneurship aspects of technical and scientific knowledge, entrepreneurship, social and environmental awareness, experiential education and values and ethics into the curricula would provide universities with capacity to promote rural entrepreneurship. © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Cocoa agroecosystems are a major land-use type in the tropical rainforest belt of West Africa, reportedly associated with several ecological changes, including soil degradation. This study aims to develop a composite soil degradation assessment index (CSDI) for determining the degradation level of cocoa soils under smallholder agroecosystems of southwestern Nigeria. Plots where natural forests have been converted to cocoa agroecosystems of ages 1-10, 11-40, and 41-80 years, respectively representing young cocoa plantations (YCPs), mature cocoa plantations (MCPs), and senescent cocoa plantations (SCPs), were identified to represent the biological cycle of the cocoa tree. Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 to 20cm in each plot and analysed in terms of their physical, chemical, and biological properties. Factor analysis of soil data revealed four major interacting soil degradation processes: Decline in soil nutrients, loss of soil organic matter, increase in soil acidity, and the breakdown of soil textural characteristics over time. These processes were represented by eight soil properties (extractable zinc, silt, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), available phosphorus, total porosity, pH, and clay content). These soil properties were subjected to forward stepwise discriminant analysis (STEPDA), and the result showed that four soil properties (extractable zinc, cation exchange capacity, SOM, and clay content) are the most useful in separating the studied soils into YCP, MCP, and SCP. In this way, we have sufficiently eliminated redundancy in the final selection of soil degradation indicators. Based on these four soil parameters, a CSDI was developed and used to classify selected cocoa soils into three different classes of degradation. The results revealed that 65\% of the selected cocoa farms are moderately degraded, while 18\% have a high degradation status. The numerical value of the CSDI as an objective index of soil degradation under cocoa agroecosystems was statistically validated. The results of this study reveal that soil management should promote activities that help to increase organic matter and reduce Zn deficiency over the cocoa growth cycle. Finally, the newly developed CSDI can provide an early warning of soil degradation processes and help farmers and extension officers to implement rehabilitation practices on degraded cocoa soils.},

However, these forecasts have low utility among farmers in agricultural decision making, unless translated into a more understood portfolio of farm management options. Towards achieving this translation, we developed a mathematical programming model that integrates seasonal climate forecasts to assess ‘what-if?’ crop choice scenarios for famers. We used the Rayapalli village in southern India as a case study. The model maximises expected profitability at village level subject to available resource constraints. The main outputs of the model are the optimal cropping patterns and corresponding agricultural management decisions such as fertiliser, biocide, labour and machinery use. The model is set up to run in two steps. In the first step the initial climate forecast is used to calculate the optimal farm plan and corresponding agricultural management decisions at a village scale. The second step uses a ‘revised forecast’ that is given six weeks later during the growing season. In scenarios where the forecast provides no clear expectation for a dry or wet season the model utilises the total agricultural land available. A significant area is allocated to redgram (pigeon pea) and the rest to maize and paddy rice. In a forecast where a dry season is more probable, cotton is the predominant crop selected. In scenarios where a ‘normal’ season is expected, the model chooses predominantly cotton and maize in addition to paddy rice and redgram. As part of the stakeholder engagement process, we operated the model in an iterative way with participating farmers. For ‘deficient’ rainfall season, farmers were in agreement with the model choice of leaving a large portion of the agriculture land as fallow with only 40 ha (total area 136 ha) of cotton and subsistence paddy rice area. While the model crop choice was redgram in ‘above normal and wet seasons, only a few farmers in the village favoured redgram mainly because of high labour requirements, and the farmers perceptions about risks related to pests and diseases. This highlighted the discrepancy between the optimal cropping pattern, calculated with the model and the farmer's actual decisions which provided useful insights into factors affecting farmer decision making that are not always captured by models. We found that planning for a ‘normal’ season alone is likely to result in losses and opportunity costs and an adaptive climate risk management approach is prudent. In an interactive feedback workshop, majority of participating farmers agreed that their knowledge on the utility and challenges of SCF have highly improved through the participation in this research and most agreed that exposure to the model improved their understanding of the role of SCF in crop choice decisions and that the modelling tool was useful to discuss climate risk in agriculture. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The preference of an innovation systems approach to development is based on its inclusiveness and the interactions of actors to co-influence each other, to learn and innovate and to bring about tangible benefits. As more actors with diverse interests engage, the innovation system becomes more complex and actors with higher influence power are likely to benefit more. Smallholder farmers in developing countries are the core actors of an agricultural innovation system, but their ability to influence other actors to maximize their benefits is questionable. This article applies a historical analysis of the progressive development and complexity of Malawi’s diary innovation system through phased emphasis on technological, organizational and institutional development to illustrate the centrality of smallholder dairy farmers in the innovation system. A social network analysis is applied to assess the influence of smallholder farmers on other actors. The existence and growth of the diary innovation system in Malawi is founded on the resilience of smallholder dairy farmers to produce milk. Whereas the smallholder farmers are the most connected in terms of interaction, they have the least influence on other actors in the innovation system. To take advantage of their central position to maximize benefits, smallholder farmers can only rely on their collective power to influence others. Organizing farmers in groups and associations is a step in the right direction but deliberate interventions by innovation brokers as intermediaries need to focus on empowering these groups. © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {The ineffectiveness of policy advice in most African countries could be attributed, amongst others, to the problem of scientists not being able to present or communicate a holistic solutions to policy challenges. As a result, the potential and actual consequences of policies are seldom indicated. It may be demanding to use a more comprehensive and quantitative research method in policy analysis because of limited resources to integrate technical, biophysical with the socio-economic and political variables when analysing policy effects. To exemplify this phenomenon, a forward-looking and prescriptive economic analysis that is being widely used for ex-ante policy analyses was used to make a contribution to the discussion on land redistribution, which is presently not only one of the most definitive political and development issues, but perhaps the most intractable in South Africa. The study develops and uses a mathematical model for regionalised farm-level resource use and output supply response to show that the current policy requires more economic imperatives, as it tends towards smallholder agriculture that has elements of low capital threshold trap. After 30\% of the farmland will have been transferred from the large farm type to settle more units of small farm type by 2015, the decrease in the number of large farm units from about 8531 units in the base year to about 7112 farm units will lead to a decline in crop and animal product supplies. Such declines (about 15.3\%) will overwhelm the increase of more than 1600\% in supplies as a result of increased small farm units. Given the challenges of a free market and the fact that the current farm settlement arrangement lacks appreciable efficiency, the study prescribes land redistribution strategies that consider efficiency along with equity. Taking size as an indication of efficiency, an increase in technical progress at 1, 5 and 10\% is expected to shift the supply curves to the right for less risky crop and animal enterprises meaning having more farmland, which may imply reduced lack of capital constraints would not necessarily imply a general increase in all the production activities because of relative risks in revenues. The study however, suggests that agricultural land can act as a safety net for the poor, where the efficiency argument does not hold. © 2008 Society for Policy Modeling.},

In this article we describe the application of a sound planning model, the PRECEDE model, in order to develop a health promotion strategy for the control of T. solium infections in Mbulu District, northern Tanzania, where the parasite is highly prevalent. During the epidemiological assessment T. solium was identified as a parasite of public health importance in the area. The social assessment revealed that porcine cysticercosis caused by T. solium was indeed an important problem for the smallholder pig farmers. Behavioural and environmental assessment revealed various factors that facilitated the transmission of T. solium in the area, including free ranging pigs, not using pit latrines, eating infected pork and drinking unboiled water. Poor knowledge on the parasite mode of transmission and public health impact and perceived barriers to adoption of better pig management practices were among factors that predisposed people to the behaviours that facilitated the transmission of the parasite. Finally, public extension services in the community were inadequate. Using the PRECEDE model we were able to identify the foci of our intervention based on the principles of importance and changeability. In conclusion, the PRECEDE model is a useful model in the development of public health interventions in the area toward the prevention of infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {A study conducted in three Tanzanian Districts in 2000 focused attention on stakeholders who have leadership, administrative, and various technical and development roles in relation to smallholders and cashew production. These stakeholders to a large extent shared the same perception of why and how sulphur fungicide must be used to ensure cashew production in the face of a perceived disease threat from powdery mildew disease (Oidium anacardii Noack). A standardised sulphur-based strategy for control of this serious disease was strongly favoured by the shared understanding, and by a coalition of organisational and financial resources of influential stakeholders. Major efforts to promote alternative knowledge and understanding about powdery mildew disease and its integrated control have, to a disturbing extent, not reached either the majority of producers or other stakeholders. Important factors limiting access to this knowledge were: poor integration of the knowledge and other resource networks of farmers and key non-farming stakeholders with official sources of alternative cashew crop protection and IPM information; ambiguity amongst researchers and development practitioners concerning the potential of IPM in cashew; deficient communication methods; and limited ideas on how to promote the active learning required for IPM. Researchers' understanding of the potential for IPM in cashew can be enriched through study of those farmers who have begun to practice their own local forms of IPM. Ways to enhance wider communication and testing of IPM concepts are suggested. These measures can help the emergence of a stronger consensus within the research establishment, and amongst intermediary and end-users of powdery mildew disease control information, for more vigorous development, promotion and use of IPM strategies in cashew powdery mildew control. © 2003 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

Food localization as a counter movement to globalization has been extensively studied for its debatable role in promoting the sustainability of food systems in developed economies. Previous studies failed to recognize food localization initiatives driven by the state and its significant impact on suburban farmland use. To fill this gap, this study discusses the key features of state-led food localization with the case of Nanjing, China through examining governmental policy documents, local food production plans and the remote sensing data of greenhouse expansion. Furthermore, the impacts of a state-led food localization strategy on the transition of suburban farmland use, particularly on the expansion of greenhouses, have been investigated by employing the binary logistic regression model. We argue that state-led food localization has substantially promoted the expansion of greenhouse farming for the purpose of stabilizing a sufficient local food supply, particularly vegetables. It has also provided support through means such as subsidy, agriculture extension service and technology training to smallholders, including local and migrant farmers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Climate change is likely to generate severe impacts on smallholder farmers in developing countries. As key drivers of adaptation, climate risk perceptions are highly heterogeneous, varying both across people and context, and are complex, being defined as behaviour which varies across both impact and likelihood dimensions in non-linear ways. Yet most studies examining risk perceptions are unable to disentangle the role of perceptions regarding impacts from those regarding the likelihood of climate-related events taking place. This paper presents a decomposition and associated analysis of survey-based ‘risk perception’ measures. The decomposition we apply allows independent accounting for perceptions over frequencies and impacts linking to behavioural patterns of risk attitude. The approach presented here draws on a detailed 2017 survey of 500 farmers in rural Indonesia to generate insights into the relationship between risk perceptions and extension services, accessibility of information, and other factors. Results show that risk perceptions are generated from complex interaction between perceived future frequencies and outcomes of climate events and indicate differential impacts of extension services across these perceptions. This paper also presents empirical support for the use of information and communication technology based extension as an efficient extension tool to reach more farmers than in traditional methods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper analyzes the social–ecological crisis presented by the Hemileia vastatrix outbreak, with a focus on how global, regional and national dynamics interact with local processes in the Chiapas Sierra Madre of south-eastern Mexico, a biodiversity hotspot with a tradition of smallholder, shade-grown coffee production. We explore the hypothesis that the current coffee rust epidemic is an expression of global environmental change, with implications for legal frameworks and international efforts towards risk management and climate change adaptation. Addressing debates on legal resilience building, we illustrate how mismatches of scale between social–ecological phenomena and legal and institutional arrangements may generate pathological solutions for small-scale coffee producers and shade-grown coffee ecosystems. Thereafter, using the analytical lens of modularity, the paper sheds light on landscape stewardship to reduce the risks of non-resilient characteristics such as isolation, on the one hand, and on the other, over-connectedness of habitat patches in the landscape of importance for ecosystem functions at larger scales. The interdisciplinary framework leads to recognizing the role of institutions and legal arrangements which are not limited to national boundaries in proposing solutions to this social–ecological crisis. We find that matching scales of law with agroforestry systems can be done through a variety of legal and policy instruments to contribute to resilience building. This matching of scales is vital to safeguarding biodiversity’s global benefits and the right of small-scale coffee farmers to a healthy and sustainable environment. © 2019, The Author(s).},

The semi-arid regions of East Africa suffer under demographic pressure and soil depletion. Ecosystem degradation becomes particularly visible along rivers in semiarid regions of south-east Kenya, where former pristine riparian forests have been transformed into agricultural fields and settlements with negative effects on ecosystem services. In this study, we aim to understand how local smallholders perceive the challenges for the riparian ecosystems and what factors affect their engagement in environmental conservation. We surveyed about 200 farmers and performed expert interviews with representatives from governmental institutions from the field of land- and resource management along Nzeeu River in south-east Kenya. We assessed the level of education, land use practices, environmental knowledge, attitudes and the willingness to contribute to nature conservation. We tested for spatial bias to understand smallholders’ perceptions on environmental challenges. Our data show that land division due to inheritance is not perceived as a problem by the farmers. However, owners holding {\textless} 1 ha of land property are less willing to spare some of their land for conservation, as opposed to those holding land plots above this size. Despite a high level of general willingness to conserve ecosystems, our data underline that local people hardly actively engage in conservation action. Furthermore, our data indicate a communication gap between local smallholders and regional governmental officers as well as overconfidence in mass media through the radio which can contradict successful adoption of pro-environment behavior. Sustainable land management in our study area is not a matter of education, but depends from the size of land property.

It demonstrates the importance of aspirations to informing agricultural policies and understanding the behaviour of farmers and their vision regarding their farms. The Heckman two-step regression model was used to determine factors affecting aspirations/willingness of farmers to expand in the first stage and their ability to achieve or realise those aspirations in the second stage. The paper identifies five key factors that influence farmer aspirations (willingness to expand), i.e., positive psychological capital, access to markets, access to credit, land tenure security, and membership in other social groups. Gender, asset ownership, access to markets and local resource use conflicts were significant in determining farmers’ ability to achieve those aspirations. The study reveals the importance of developing positive psychological capital among smallholders and affirms the need for affordable production credit. To better make use of irrigation schemes, there is a need to build the capacity of smallholders to achieve their aspirations through empowering women and improving access to physical assets and markets.

	abstract = {Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) provide guidance to policy makers, the private sector and consumers to redesign food systems and to improve diets of vulnerable populations. As appropriate FBDGs are based on the actual dietary patterns and their costs, it is assumed that the recommended foods are available, affordable and acceptable for the population under study. Using quantitative dietary intake data of young children in rural Northern Ghana, we developed local FBDGs and studied whether these are supported by the diversity and quantity of the production of a household among 329 households. We found that 40\% of rural Northern Ghanaian infants and young children were stunted and their nutrient intakes were far below the recommendations: the probability of adequacy for most nutrient intakes was less than 50\%. At household level, the developed FBDGs were, on average, unable to sufficiently cover the household requirements for fat (60.4\% of recommended nutrient intake (RNI)), calcium (34.3\% RNI), iron (60.3\% RNI), vitamin A (39.1\% RNI), vitamin B12 (2.3\% RNI) and vitamin C (54.6\% RNI). This implies that even when these FBDGs are fully adopted the requirements for these nutrients will not be met. In addition, the nutrient needs and food needs (according to the developed FBDGs) of a household were only marginally covered by their own food production. The food production of over half the households supplied insufficient calcium (75.7\%), vitamin A (100\%), vitamin B12 (100\%) and vitamin C (77.5\%) to cover their needs. The food production of about 60\% of the households did not cover their required quantities of grains and legumes and none covered their required quantities of vegetables. Further analysis of the food gaps at district and national level showed that sufficient grains were available at both levels (267\% and 148\%, respectively) to meet requirements; availability of legumes was sufficient at district level (268\%) but not at national level (52\%); and vegetables were insufficient at both levels (2\% and 49\%, respectively). Diversifying household food production is often proposed as a means to increase the diversity of foods available and thereby increasing dietary diversity of rural populations. We found that the diversity of the production of a household was indeed positively related with their food and nutrient coverage. However, the diversity of the production of a household and their food and nutrient coverage were not related with children’s dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy. Our results show that the production of a households does not support the adoption of FBDGs in rural Northern Ghana, especially for vegetables. This suggests that the promotion of FBDGs through nutrition education or behaviour change communications activities alone is insufficient to lead to improvements in diets. Additional strategies are needed to increase the food availability and accessibility of the households, especially that of fruits and vegetables, such as diversification of the crops grown, increased production of specific crops and market-based strategies. © 2018 de Jager et al.

	abstract = {Edutainment, the combination of education with entertainment through various media such as television, radio, mobile phone applications and games, is increasingly being used as an approach to stimulate innovation and increase agricultural productivity amongst smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Shamba Shape Up, a widely publicised makeover reality TV programme, is an example of edutainment that has received considerable attention, and airs in three countries in East Africa where it is estimated to be watched by millions of viewers. There is no published academic research on the influence of makeover television formats on innovation systems and processes in smallholder agriculture. Using an Agricultural Innovation Systems approach, this paper explores how makeover edutainment is influencing smallholder farmer innovation systems together with the effect this is having on smallholder farms. In the absence of previous research, it articulates a Theory of Change which draws on research traditions from mass communication, agricultural extension and innovation systems. Data came from two large scale quantitative (n = 9885 and n = 1572) surveys and in-depth participatory qualitative research comprising focus group discussions, participatory budgets, agricultural timelines, case studies and key information interviews in Kenya. An estimated 430,000 farmers in the study area were benefiting from their interaction with the programme through increased income and / or a range of related social benefits including food security, improving household health, diversification of livelihood choices, paying school fees for children and increasing their community standing / social capital. Participatory research showed SSU enhanced an already rich communication environment and strengthened existing processes of innovation. It helped set the agenda for discussions within farming communities about opportunities for improving smallholder farms, while also giving specific ideas, information and knowledge, all in the context of featured farm families carefully selected so that a wide range of viewers would identify with them and their challenges. Broadcasts motivated and inspired farmers to improve their own farms through a range of influences including entertainment, strong empathy with the featured host farm families, the way ideas emerged through interaction with credible experts, and importantly through stimulating widespread discussion and interaction amongst and between farmers and communities of experts on agricultural problems, solutions and opportunities. The fact that local extension workers also watched the programmes further enhanced the influence on local innovation systems. The findings indicate that well designed makeover edutainment can strongly influence agricultural innovation processes and systems resulting in impact on the agricultural production and behaviours of large numbers of smallholder farmers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ugandan smallholder farmers need to feed a growing population, but their efforts are hampered by declining soil fertility rates. Agricultural extension can facilitate farmers’ access to new practices and technologies, yet farmers are understandably often hesitant to adopt new behaviors. New knowledge assimilation is an important component of behavior change that is often overlooked or poorly addressed by current extension efforts. We implemented a Fertility Management Education Program (FMEP) in central Uganda to investigate smallholder farmers’ existing soil knowledge and their assimilation of new scientific concepts into their knowledge framework. Qualitative data were collected through participant observation, farmer interviews, and focus groups, and coded for using a priori and emergent themes. Our exploration revealed some notable similarities between farmers’ soil knowledge and scientific concepts, particularly in regards to soil health concepts, a discovery that could facilitate communication between extension agents and farmers. However, certain scientific concepts are either unknown to farmers or discordant with existing soil knowledge; these concepts are unlikely to be assimilated by farmers without convincing and concerted extension efforts. Importantly, we found that the combination of new scientific knowledge and hands-on experimentation with novel practices gave farmers far greater confidence in implementing improved soil management practices. Our study provides evidence that extension programs should engage directly with farmers’ existing soil knowledge to develop their understanding of key biological concepts and confidence in implementing improved practices. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Despite herbicide resistance (HR) causing poor weed control, yield losses, and reduced profits on many Australian grain growing farms, farmers seem reticent to implement integrated weed management (IWM) in their farming systems. This is despite research showing IWM and the various techniques used as part of an IWM strategy are successful. As an Australian grain grower with 35 years of farming experience, and someone who has actively studied weed management and engaged with research, I would like to share with you my thoughts on why IWM (utilization of both chemical and non-chemical control tactics) has not been fully adopted by many as part of their farming system. The catalyst for my thoughts in this article was a visit to a farmer who had a total crop failure due to HR annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum). Despite having a significant economic loss and facing ongoing poor weed control, the farmer was not willing to use a non-herbicide method of weed management let alone implement IWM in his farming system. I have since pondered why farmers would ignore research evidence and continue down the path of total dependence on herbicides. IWM is essential if farming is to remain sustainable into the future. In the 1970s, Australian agriculture began a significant change in how winter grain crops were grown, with a shift to using conservation agriculture (CA). Before then, cropping systems were modelled directly on those in Europe and were heavily dependent on cultivation. Such systems were not well suited to Australia's fragile environment, with its old, thin soils and large regions of low rainfall. The arrival of both non-selective and selective herbicides, enabled farmers to change the way they farmed dramatically by implementing CA. Cultivation was no longer a requirement, allowing reduced tillage or even zero-tillage. Conservation agriculture allowed Australian farmers to retain crop residues and increase the water use efficiency of their crops. This farming approach was found to be far more efficient and has produced environmental benefits such as reduced soil erosion. However, successful CA is very dependent on herbicides. Initially, this dependence on herbicides was not problematic, because herbicides were very effective. However, herbicide resistance has developed and is now widespread in Australia and 69 other countries. Our family farming enterprise embraced CA in the late 1970s, initially cultivating only at crop seeding. Our system has continued to evolve, and today we practise zero tillage and retain crop residues. In 1995, we made the decision to remove livestock from the system and move to continuous cropping. We first began to see HR in ryegrass during the late 1990s. Like many farmers when first seeing HR, we responded by spraying the paddocks with a different herbicide. That bought us some time, but by 2000 we had our first crop failure due to HR. This failure occurred in a crop of lupins (Lupinus spp.), a relatively uncompetitive species, and the ryegrass outcompeted the lupins to the extent that we made silage out of the crop rather than harvest it, thereby introducing a non-chemical control option. This experience demonstrated to us the financial and management cost HR can impose on a farming business. When farms have HR, farmers' options for managing their paddocks become limited as the herbicides they once relied upon are no longer effective. Through adoption of IWM we have been able to overcome HR ryegrass. That does not mean that we have eliminated the weed completely, but we have tried to maintain the seed bank at low levels so it is easier to manage. If we do have a large increase in ryegrass plant numbers in a paddock, I now know that the longer I take to deal with the issue, the harder, more expensive, and more radical will be the management actions to overcome it. Convincing farmers to embrace IWM can be challenging, but farmers in Australia are increasingly recognising the value of IWM to their farming systems. This ongoing change in mindset and practice has taken a combination of suffering from HR combined with good research, proactive extension and the promotion of leading farmers' experiences to encourage adoption of IWM as a mainstream practice. It is important for researchers and farm advisors to understand why farmers in their communities are reticent to try IWM. The Australian experience has shown that improving the uptake of IWM is possible through interactive engagement with farmers who have already shown they have a willingness to adapt their farming systems. Incorporating IWM into my system has made it more profitable and more sustainable. Extending experiences such as mine to other farmers is imperative to maintain the effectiveness of the valuable resource we have in herbicides. © 2018 Research Information Ltd.},

We developed new knowledge of agriculture clearing sizes, spatial patterns, and relationships with roads in seven case study sites comprising 7,529 km2. Using very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, we mapped roads and rivers, plus clearings for agriculture, settlements, and logging. Mapped clearings (N = 1,781) ranged in size from 0.008 ha to more than 300 ha; most were smallholder agriculture, with 64 percent ≤ 1 ha. Statistical tests of spatial pattern confirmed that agriculture occurred in an inhomogeneous-aggregated pattern, suggesting interactions with other landscape elements. Proximity analyses showed that 76 percent of clearings were within 1 km of a road or river. Thirty-five percent of agriculture clearings were within 1 km of main public roads built before 1990, compared to 17 percent for logging roads built after 2000. Less than 6 percent of agriculture clearings were within 1 km of logging roads with overgrown canopies, suggesting transient relationships. Results based on fine-scale data provide new empirical support for understanding the interactions between agriculture and roads in one of the remaining relatively intact forest areas of the Congo Basin. © 2018 by American Association of Geographers.},

	abstract = {Agricultural producers grapple with low farm yields and declining ecosystem services within their landscapes. In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as AlternateWetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions ( 70\%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22\% to 55\%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration. © 2017 by the authors.},

Specifically, the study sought to tap into the expertise and perspectives of locally important stakeholders in the potentially sensitive Wami/Ruvu River catchment of Tanzania. Participatory scenario planning was used to explore sectors sensitive to climate variability and change. This included 84 selected smallholder farmers and their leaders spread across six villages within the catchment. Quantitative household surveys were conducted across 199 households and Supplementary information sourced from regional statistics. The survey indicates that farmers project that land and agricultural productivity and water resources will be affected by climate change. From the participatory approach adopted for the study, thematic scenario categories featuring land and water resource-use and management and farm productivity were developed. The research found scenario analysis as a useful tool in development planning, as it incorporates interacting risks and uncertainties. If adopted by local farmers, leaders, regional institutional frameworks and policy makers, the tool has the potential to improve responsiveness to changes and risks through its collaborative management approach.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Study tools and methods were questionnaire survey (N = 200), focus group discussion (N = 1), in-depth interviews (N = 18) and field direct observation. Findings: This study shows there existed diversity of information resources in Hohoe. This diversity was, however, devoid of a broad integration process to enhance smallholder access to and use of agricultural information. We demonstrate that new information channels or sources cannot function independently, but rather through an integrated approach that relies on a human facet of extension. Practical Implications: We illustrate the need for integrated extension that includes interactive field modules such as basic cell phone decision guides that support smallholder construction of solutions for their circumstances. This process requires new sets of smallholder skills and holistic extension schemes that diversify information resources through incorporation and adaptation, rather than substitution. New information resources can only be gradually mainstreamed through integration with more familiar extension means. They need a human interface because smallholder householders did not require same types and/or amounts of information. Human interface is essential to ensure critical groups including women access and utilise agricultural information resources, but without entrenching unfair task allocations among smallholder householders. Originality/Value: This paper illustrates how extension can be strengthened through new approaches. However, new approaches such as use of basic cell phones cannot be standalone processes; they require a human interface and an integrated process.

The scale and usage of household forests is a critical issue that concerns the methods and efficiency of forest management. By conducting a socio-economic survey of 175 households, this paper examines the status of household forestry as well as its utilization in Shangnan County, northern China, and the way in which farmers and their local forest authority interact. Approximately 80 \% of households were found to have forest land. Among households which had forestry, nearly half had a forest area of 1 μ (0.07 ha) or less. Fuelwood for household use was the main product of household forests. About 70 \% of households regarded fuelwood as their main energy source. Socio-economic factors including financial situation, household size, occupation and educational level of householder were not significantly correlated with the energy choice or the amount of fuelwood consumed. In order to improve the development of household forests, it is necessary to promote better communication between households and forest authorities. The coppice system appears to be a useful forest management strategy because it not only maintains continuous forest cover but also satisfies the high demand for fuelwood in this county. © 2015, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

The next phase focuses on two types of intermediaries to reach smallholder farmers: agro-dealers and youth. This review reflects this focus and is therefore biased towards recent publications relevant to these intermediaries and also the impact of gender on provision of and access to agricultural information. There is a consistent demand for information on new varieties, pests and diseases, use of pesticides and fertilizer, as well as weather, credit and markets. The most frequently used sources of information are still the more traditional ones. Extension services, family, friends and neighbours, and agro-dealers are all important face-to-face sources of information. Radio dominates as the main mass media source. Local agro-dealers are often included by smallholder farmers among the most frequently used sources of information and they enjoy a degree of trust. There has been considerable investment by donors in extending and strengthening agro-dealer networks over recent years, including more emphasis on their roles as sources of information and advice. A new type of tech-savvy young entrepreneurial farmer is emerging who is more likely to wield a smartphone than a hoe. This is especially important against a background in which, despite the median age in African being just 19.7 years, the average age of farmers is estimated to be over 55. Family farming is receiving renewed emphasis. During its phase 2, which will run from 2015 to 2019, ASHC will share its experiences, successes and failures, and lessons learned in working with agro-dealers and youth intermediaries. In this way it aims to help others to communicate their key messages more effectively including via these intermediaries. © 2015 CAB International.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of crossbreeding on reproductive performance. A village based sheep crossbreeding project has been implemented since 1998 in three villages in the South Wollo, Menz and Chacha districts in Ethiopia. Crossbred rams (3/4 Awassi × 1/4 Local) were supplied to a group of farmers aiming to upgrading the indigenous genotype through backcrossing. The combined levels of location and genotype, year, season and parity had significant effects on the reproductive performance of ewes. Generally, local genotypes showed better (p{\textless}0.05) reproductive performance except for number of lambs weaned per ewe per year. The interaction of genotype and location was significant for age at first lambing and lambing interval. In Wollo, Corriedale × local crossbred ewes had similar reproductive performance to that of the local breed. The variation in reproductive performance among locations indicated the importance of delineating crossbreeding areas depending on environmental situation and farmers' capacity.},

	abstract = {The study assessed the impact of climate change adaptation strategies on technical efficiency of smallholder rice farmers in South-west Nigeria. An endogeneity corrected stochastic frontier model which account for the endogeneity of adoption of adaptation strategies that is likely to depend on inefficiency was employed for the study. The result of the study revealed that adoption of adaption strategies is endogenously determined with rice productivity and hence, failure to account for endogeneity, the parameter efficiency estimates would be inconsistent. The empirical results from the model show that quantity of labour, herbicides and the interaction of labour with both farm size and insecticides were statistically significant in explaining the variations in the efficiency of rice production in the study area. In addition, the study identified the combined effects of climate change adaptation strategies and some socioeconomic characteristics such as age, gender, education, farming experience, access to credit, access to information, membership of farmers in agricultural based cooperative and location of rice farmers as sources of technical inefficiencies. The study concluded that increase implementation of climate change adaptation strategies could enhance rice productivity and technical efficiency of rice farmers through timely access to climate change information and other related institutional support. Based on farmers' knowledge and understanding of changes in climatic conditions and the adaptation strategies to mitigate its effect, it is therefore important for the government, stakeholders and donor agencies to involve farmers in the climate change adaptation planning process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The EAU4Food project, aimed at increasing food production in irrigation schemes in Africa through improved farming strategies, used a platform design inspired by the community of practice (CoP) concept, which opened up space for farmers' interactive learning and enabled their active participation in the innovation process. In this article we present examples of how this approach has been implemented in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Tunisia. We analyse the level of farmers' participation that was achieved at different stages of the implementation process, namely: deciding how to set up the CoP, identifying innovation needs and conducting the experiment. Among different strategies deployed by EAU4Food researchers, working with dialogue groups, engaging farmers in data interpretation and passing the responsibility over elements of the research process to farmers, proved to be the most effective in strengthening farmers' involvement. The use of a simulation game to test innovations also showed promising results and should be explored further. The attitude of researchers proved to be an important factor in achieving a high level of farmers' engagement in the project. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

	abstract = {Global economic value of agriculture production resulting from animal pollination services has been estimated to be \$235-\$577 billion. This estimate is based on quantification of crops that are available at the global markets, and mainly originates from countries with precise information about quantities of agriculture production, exports, and imports. In contrast, knowledge about the contribution of pollinators to household food and income in small-scale farming at local and regional scales is still lacking, especially for developing countries where the availability of agricultural statistics is limited. Although the global decline in pollinator diversity and abundance has received much attention, relatively little effort has been directed towards understanding the role of pollinators in small-scale farming systems, which feed a substantial part of the world's population. Here, we have assessed how local farmers in northern Tanzania depend on insect-pollinated crops for household food and income, and to what extent farmers are aware of the importance of insect pollinators and how they can conserve them. Our results show that local farmers in northern Tanzania derived their food and income from a wide range of crop plants, and that 67\% of these crops depend on animal pollination to a moderate to essential degree. We also found that watermelon-for which pollination by insects is essential for yield-on average contributed nearly 25\% of household income, and that watermelons were grown by 63\% of the farmers. Our findings indicate that local farmers can increase their yields from animal pollinated crops by adopting more pollinator-friendly farming practices. Yet, we found that local farmers' awareness of pollinators, and the ecosystem service they provide, was extremely low, and intentional actions to conserve or manage them were generally lacking. We therefore urge agriculture authorities in Tanzania to act to ensure that local farmers become aware of insect pollinators and their important role in agriculture production. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The overall willingness of smallholder farmers to adopt new green technologies remains low, in spite of the great progress made in understanding the factors that affect their decision. The present study introduces an interdisciplinary approach combining positive psychology and sustainable development studies to show that two personal resources – self-control (a learned repertoire of goal-directed skills that enable people to act upon their aims) and cognitive goal-oriented hope (the ability to follow different routes to pursue one's goal), prompt the adoption of technologies by smallholder farmers. Both personal resources facilitate achieving future goals and changing existing circumstances. A theoretical moderation model on the adoption of agricultural technologies aimed to protect soil degradation in Nepal is proposed and empirically tested. Data were collected from 268 households in the Jhapa district by a face-to-face questionnaire. A multiple regression analysis tested and confirmed the hypothesized moderation model. Following the discovery of a significant interaction, the nature of the interaction was farther explored by calculating simple slopes. Analysis results show a significant positive connection between self-control (p-value = 0.002), hope (p-value = 0.005), information (p-value {\textless} 0.001), and technology adoption. Self-control was also found to have a significant moderating effect in enhancing a positive association between receiving information and technology adoption (p-value = 0.017). In addition to its theoretical innovation and empirical contribution, the importance of this study lies in its practical implications, given that policy, education, and communication may influence hope and self-control levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Usually, this information is most sparse where most needed, (sub)tropical smallholder-dominated landscapes. Our study enhances planning methods for food-security and climate change adaptation in rain-fed smallholder agriculture of South Central Ethiopia. In a case study covering 10,500 km2 and four agroecological zones, we developed a phenology-oriented approach for dynamic classification of cropping systems using Google Earth Engine. Complementary datasets of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index were merged, increasing time resolution from 16 to 8 days. Derived pixel-and crop-specific seasonal time series at 250 m resolution reflected vegetation phenology. Random Forest was applied to classify agricultural LU types and cropping systems. Vegetation period onset, validated against farmers’ sowing dates, was used to detect crop rotations and map drought risk for the years 2003–2018. Identified LU types were: single cropping (maize/haricot bean, wheat/barley), and double cropping (maize/other, maize/wheat). Overall accuracy for agricultural LU was 76–94\%.We use open source data and online data processing. High temporal resolution phenology data allow identifying needs for agricultural inputs and emergency support “in real time”, assess drought risk and monitor LU dynamics. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In Africa, many governments and development agencies have promoted aquaculture as a panacea for household food security, rural development, and poverty reduction. However, aquaculture production in the continent remains low despite significant investments in research and technology development. While numerous initiatives have been directed at technological innovation and transfer, their present scale of uptake is very slow and therefore inadequate to achieve transformational change envisaged in the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. In this paper, we aim to (1) critically analyze the factors that influence fish farmer’s perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward technology adoption; and (2) to determine the impacts of technology adoption on farmer’s livelihoods. Primary data were collected using a self-administered digitized questionnaire to 331 randomly selected farmers in Kenya. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze data. Results revealed that variables including secondary education, diversified on-farm activities, farm size, production levels, attendance of extension training, ease of understanding, and ease of handling technologies were positive and significant predictors of aquaculture technology adoption. However, 30\% of fish farmers were categorized as high adopters of novel aquaculture technologies, implying that there are gaps in technical skills hindering adoption of innovative technologies and best management practices. To facilitate learning and uptake of technologies and good practices by farmers, a range of aquaculture-related extension and communication materials, including posters, hard copy information leaflets and brochures of recipes in appropriate languages, short video presentations, and radio features, should be commissioned to support the smallholder farmers. © 2019, The Author(s).},

The study utilised a cross-sectional survey of a randomly selected sample of 116 KyD farmers in KwaZulu-Natal Province. A Logit model was used to analyse the data. The results show that more farmers are aware of farmgate market channels, but however, they tended to utilise auction market channels. Furthermore, gender, marital status, educational level, employment status, farm income, source of income, herd size, labour and training were significant variables in the awareness and use of butcheries, auctions and farm gate markets. The study concludes that the scheme is particularly effective in influencing commercialisation through utilisation of more lucrative market channels such as auctions. Furthermore, socio-economic factors had a bearing on the awareness and use of marketing channels for smallholder farmers in the KyD scheme. Labour was particularly significant across butchery, auction and farm gate market channels. The study recommends that the scheme needs to improve awareness and use of market channels through utilisation of information platforms such as radio, television and direct communication though mobile phones. Furthermore, extension should assist farmers not only in awareness of markets, but also in the utilisation of those markets. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilises systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis guidelines to review and synthesise recent research papers and case studies dealing specifically with the development of LVCs, authored by professionals affiliated with development agencies and international research consortiums. Findings: The paper identifies a novel two-phase characterisation of LVC interventions. Phase 1 identifies opportunities for interventions, which are characterised as typologies and presented upon a spectrum of value chain functionality from underdeveloped to mature. Phase 2 is the selection and implementation of strategies to achieve the identified opportunities from Phase 1, and the paper characterises these strategies per the domain of value chain functionality which they target. Research limitations/implications: The interaction between context, socio-economic constraints and intervention strategies is still a poorly understood feature of value chain interventions, and the paper posits that a greater understanding of these interactions is crucial to the success of value chain interventions. Originality/value: The paper provides the first synthesis of LVC interventions, while outlining research priorities and knowledge gaps required to design interventions which are consummate to the context and functionality of a prioritised chain. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The aquaculture sector in Bangladesh is an important employer and a significant source of foreign exchange. In addition, it contributes significantly to food security due to the role of fish in peoples’ diets, the most important source of protein and micronutrients. However, infectious diseases represent an important barrier to sector development due to economic losses and vulnerability of smallholders. The aim of this study was to gain an overview of the impact of infectious diseases in the aquaculture sector, and to assess the usefulness and use of impact studies in decision making for animal health management and biosecurity governance in Bangladesh. A review of scientific and grey literature on infectious disease impact in different aquaculture systems was conducted and their methodologies and findings summarised. Subsequently, interviews with 28 stakeholders from the private and public sector were conducted to enquire about decision-making structures in animal health management. The data were analysed using the framework method to allow the development of themes, by using the information, experiences and opinions inductively obtained from interviewees, deductively through the reviewed literature. Results showed a substantial socio-economic impact of infectious diseases. The numerous stakeholders involved in the decision-making process explained that key barriers to effective aquaculture health management were insufficient resources to investigate and tackle infectious aquatic animal diseases, a dearth of legislation and capacity for disease surveillance, a reliance on reactive response, and a lack of impact and evidence-based approaches for prioritising problem-solving, commonly based on anecdotal evidence. Furthermore, communication among the multiple stakeholders involved was reported to be weak. This complex situation requires a multi-level response, which should span from strengthening the knowledge of farmers and professionals in the field to the improvement of surveillance and diagnostic systems. Improved systems along with evidence on disease impact could inform the prioritisation of diseases and resource allocation for disease control in Bangladesh. Further, this evidence needs to be used to advise decisions to have a true value, for which establishing and strengthening communication pathways and processes is critical to make systematic use of the information and improve animal health management. In the light of future threats to Bangladesh such as climate change, increasing population density and demand for animal source foods, it is crucial to strengthen animal health management systems to reduce livelihoods vulnerability, food insecurity and the likelihood of disease emergence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Calf growth is an important determinant of dairy herd productivity, particularly in countries where the dairy industry is expanding, such as Kenya. Our objective was to determine factors associated with weight gain in randomly selected dairy calves and heifers in smallholder dairy farms (SDF) in Kenya. A cross-sectional study on a census of 321 calves and heifers (dairy calves and heifers up to 36 months of age), sampled from 200 randomly selected SDF in Naari, Kenya, formed the study population. Youngstock management was recorded using a questionnaire. Biodata were obtained through subsequent physical examination and heart girth measurement. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted, and mixed model regression was used for identification of factors associated (p \&lt; 0.05) with the natural log transformation of estimated average daily weight gain (ADG). Median and mean ADG of the youngstock were 360 and 443 (s.d. = 375) g day−1, respectively. In the final model, ADG was highest in pre-weaned calves and declined with age. Supplementing with quality hay during the dry season at least weekly was associated with increased ADG. There was an interaction between breed and historical disease on ADG such that disease was associated with decreased ADG in Bos taurus breeds, while ADG in Bos indicus breeds was not affected by disease. There was a significant interaction between education levels of the husband and wife caretakers; when the man's education was low (having less than or equal to primary school), ADG was highest when the woman had not completed primary school, but was lower when the woman had completed primary, secondary or tertiary education, possibly because such women worked off-farm more often. General growth performance of animals on these farms was lower than benchmarked standards recommended for optimum dairy production but within previously reported ranges for the East African region. Supplementation of diets (with hay and/or concentrates) is recommended for optimum growth in calves and heifers, especially in the dry season. If nutritional management of Bos taurus youngstock is not improved, crosses of Bos indicus could be better suited for the current nutritional management systems in SDF in Meru having calf disease problems. Interventions to support educating women (the primary caretakers of the cattle) and men in the community on calf management should be initiated, preferably with shared on-farm responsibilities. Training in better management, even for learned farmers, would be critical to better calf growth. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Increasing livestock production to meet growing demands has resulted in greater interactions at the livestock-wildlife-human interface and more opportunities for zoonotic disease spread. Zoonoses impose enormous burdens on low-income countries like Nepal, where populations are largely dependent on livestock production and access to shared grazing lands, often near protected areas, due to population pressures. Several livestock-associated zoonoses have been reported in Nepal; however, little is known regarding Nepali farmers’ knowledge of zoonoses and opportunities for disease management. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate Nepali farmers’ awareness of zoonoses, assess current health challenges, and evaluate disease prevention and control practices. We found that awareness of zoonotic pathogens was limited, especially in informally educated and illiterate farmers; the majority of which were women. Further, farmers’ preventive herd health, food safety, and sanitation practices were not associated with their awareness. Several farmers reported high-risk practices despite being aware of zoonotic diseases, suggesting a disconnect between the farmers’ awareness and practice. Our study highlights the need for improving Nepali farmers’ knowledge of zoonoses and disease prevention measures. Closing these awareness-practice gaps will require an improved understanding of risk and effective drivers of behavior change, alongside engagement of farmers in development of zoonotic disease prevention programs that encourage participation of both male and female farmers across all levels of education. © 2018 EcoHealth Alliance.},

	abstract = {Gains in increasing productivity of grain in Sub-Saharan Africa are greatly undermined by the high postharvest losses (PHLs), which compromise the food and income security of households. Rice is one such important food and cash crop experiencing high PHLs. Given the limited mechanization of smallholder farms, PHLs result from practices influenced by knowledge, decision-making power in the household and cultural norms. Gender is an important consideration in the interaction of these factors especially for a duo purpose crop like rice serving both food and income security interests of households. A descriptive cross-sectional survey informed by qualitative focus group discussions was conducted in two major rice producing districts in Eastern Uganda to establish how gender division of labour and decision-making influence PHLs at the household level. The intra-household gender structure, division of labour and decision-making determine the postharvest loses of rice at the household level. Men and boys perform the labour intensive postharvest activities where postharvest losses are high. They also dominate decisions on the practices and technologies used. Due to labour intensity and cultural norms, households without men rely on hired labour, which increases their PHLs resulting from late access to and inadequate supervision of the hired labour. Interventions for reduction of PHLs at the household level must target men with better practices and simple cost-effective technologies. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

Research has shown that JFVs, including arrangements such as farm partnerships, contract rearing and share farming, can potentially enable farmers to work cooperatively to improve farm productivity, reduce working hours, facilitate succession, develop skills and improve relationships within the farm household. In the context of increasing policy promotion of JFVs, there is a need to make some attempt at understanding the macro socio-cultural disposition of family farming to cooperation. Reviewing sociological studies of agricultural cooperation and taking a specific focus on the Irish contextual backdrop, this paper draws the reader's attention to the importance of historical legacy, pragmatic economic and social concerns, communicative norms, inter-personal relationships, individualism and, policy and extension stimuli, all of which shape farmers' dispositions to cooperation and to JFVs specifically. © 2016 Peter Cush et al., published by De Gruyter Open.},

The investigation was carried out on different beekeeping experiences in southern Brazil: peasant family farms, settlements of agrarian reform, and Afro-descent quilombola and Guarani indigenous villages. The systems are managed in the contexts of agroecological farming and include “Africanized honeybees” and native “stingless bees,” integrated among trees and crops. We show that the dynamics of investigation that follows the guidelines presented by family farmers and traditional people contribute to their empowerment and to changing their own reality, favoring endogenous development and the dialogue of knowledge. The participatory experiences by ISEC and EMBRAPA Temperate Agriculture through the organization and mobilization of farmers and traditional people generated organizational structures that build local food systems.

	abstract = {This study demonstrates the potential value of forecasts to smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe, the majority of whom often suffer severely from the impact of drought. Using crop simulation models to compare yield performances of farmers with and without forecasts, results indicate that, for a drought year, farmers with forecasts (WF) record higher yield gains (28\%) compared to those without forecasts (WOF): in particular, farmers located in the most arid regions (NR V) recorded the highest yield gains (42\%). A similar trend is observed during a neutral/average year, as farmers WF obtain predominantly higher yield gains (20\%) than those WOF. However, during a good year, results show a different pattern as no yield gains are observed. In fact, farmers WOF perform better, suggesting forecasts in this case may not make much difference. Using gross margin analysis, results show farmers WF obtaining higher returns during a drought (US\$0.14 ha-1) and neutral year (US\$0.43 ha-1) but again not for a good year as farmers WOF outperform those WF. To summarize, forecasts can play an important role as loss-minimization instruments especially if the underlying year is an El Niño (drought) year. In conclusion, to attain full economic value of forecasts, complementary policies (currently missing) such as effective communication, improvement in forecast extension skills and promotion of farmer participatory and outreach activities could prove vital in enhancing the value of forecasts to smallholder farmers in general. © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Responses to a list of 20 questionnaire items characterizing three ideal types of technological frames (conservation agriculture, conventional modern agriculture, and risk averse agriculture) were analyzed through inter-group comparisons and multiple regression.The findings indicate that there is a fundamental gap between the perspectives framing the knowledge of farmers and those of the service sector/community agents with respect to agricultural production norms and practices. Specifically, agricultural service providers and other community agents are significantly more supportive of conventional modern farming than farmers, and significantly less supportive of mixed crop and livestock farming; however, farmer perspectives also vary across sites.Recognition of multiple knowledges, their relationship to agro-ecologies and the technological frame gap between farmers and non-farm agents is important for effectively negotiating dialog among farm and non-farm knowledge networks.Our exploration of variation in local knowledges provides insights into how individual proclivities, adaptation to the agro-ecology, and a supporting set of network partners contribute to the mindset changes needed for establishing CAPS. © 2014 © 2014 Wageningen University.},

An impact assessment of the SMP project on the livelihoods of target beneficiaries was carried out in 2006 to determine the effects of the project of target community. A semi structured questionnaire jointly developed by stakeholders after identifying progress indicators was administered to 192 respondents who were randomly selected using simple random sampling technique. The farmers were stratified into participating and control or counterfactuals. The results showed that there was significant impact on target communities and other stakeholders who were involved in the project. The crop yields food supply and household earnings increased. A number of farmers, extension agents and researchers were trained on integrated soil fertility management technologies and extension methodologies. Long term impact indicated that there were increased crop and livestock yields, enhanced food availability and improved access to agricultural information.

The impact of various schemes (trajectories) in which different agents influence the producers’ decision to use new technologies was analyzed. In particular, there are differences in the influence of a) private coffee buying organizations and b) government and public development agencies on the innovation behavior of coffee growers. Drawing from network data that depict the internal and outbound connectedness of producers in three village communities in main coffee producing zones in Honduras, tools of social network analysis were applied to find out how interactions with certain agents, separately and cumulatively, has influenced their use of improved methods in coffee production and marketing. The results suggest that there are significant differences in the way that various providers of knowledge and technology, especially private buyers and development agencies, influence the farmers’ behavior towards innovation. The influence of buyers, according to the data, is focused on certification and quality aspects, whereas development agents focus on improved agronomic practices. Farmers who communicate with the extension branch of input providers tend to be more innovative. These results suggest that development programs should take more seriously into account the role of private actors in innovation among agricultural producers and, hence, design development programs in such a way to allow for collaboration with these agents. © 2010.

To avoid generalising explanations with regard to land-use change, interactions between proximate causes and underlying driving forces adopted from a meta-analysis model are explored through 23 in-depth interviews. This was done through collaborative work with farmers in northern Shaanxi Province and focused on the land-use situation between 1982 and 2005. The result reveals five categories of land-use change. The interaction pattern is broken down into eight proximate causes and four underlying driving forces. The dominant underlying driving forces are economic forces with short time horizons arising partly from compensation through policies, changes in crop demand from an expanding nearby market and a need for cash because of an increasingly cash-based lifestyle. The direct proximate causes were vividly described by the farmers as tools or means by which they are adapting to more abstract and indirect factors. These factors were identified as underlying driving forces. Hence, the knowledge and ability to separate the interaction into proximate causes and underlying driving forces are crucial in policy-making. © 2009 Taylor \& Francis.},

This paper revives an old solution that has been fully considered in the dialogue regarding educational reform, i.e., rural agrarian development. Because the vast majority of Kenyans are dependent upon the land for their livelihood, they have been forced by growing land scarcity to seek wage employment. In turn, education has become the prerequisite for such employment. In order to moderate the demand for education, the economic strategies of Kenyan smallholders must be altered. This can be done by increasing the efficiency of resource use in the ural areas and increasing access to land, in addition to the current employment generation efforts. © 1991.},

	abstract = {Developing a conceptual model is vital for small-scale organic farmer's credit access to sustain the livelihoods. However, smallholders continually face severe problems in getting finance that lead to reduce investment and in turn, challenges the livelihoods. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to establish and empirically test a theoretical model to explore how agility and innovativeness in organic food value chain finance are achieved through ITI, TRST, CG, ICT, and IS, and how these, in turn, can accelerate financial flow in the value chain and enhance competitiveness. The present study used a survey method and collected data from small-scale farmers, traders, and financial institutions. The model and hypothesis are tested using data obtained from 331 respondents through partial least square structure equation modeling techniques. We argue that development of theoretical model show potential to increase creditworthiness of smallholders and overcome uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangement. Thus, the present study could provide new ways to integrate the value chain partners, through information and communication technology and governance arrangements in the organic food value chain financing. This study demonstrates that the mediations of innovativeness and agility significantly affect the development of new financial products to make agile the financial flow, which in turn positively influences value chain competitiveness. Significant judgments are required for trustworthy relations among the value chain partners to positively harness innovative product development for swifter value chain finance. Therefore, this theoretical model should not be regarded as a quick solution, but a process of testing, error, and learning by doing so. © 2020 Abid et al.

	abstract = {Smallholders play a key role in implementing best management practices that increase productivity and reduce environmental effects. However, they often lack the knowledge to implement these standards. This study investigates if and how RSPO certification fosters upstream learning to improve farming practices. Taking a comparative approach between Thailand and Indonesia we find that the current structure of the value chain is not always well-suited for upstream learning beyond knowledge transfer. In particular, farmers in Indonesia suffer from the delegation of practices to the mill and cooperative, and from incentive-incompatible pricing practices, limiting the extent to which farmers absorb new knowledge on farming practices. In Thailand instead, price incentives based on quality are more developed, and only hindered by the presence of intermediary collectors. This makes that Thai farmers are systematically more aware of farming and environmental practices, and more likely to report compliance with RSPO principles and criteria. Their relatively higher independence in farming decision-making, however, results in weaker peer-to-peer interactions and higher deviations from best management practices, with consequences both for productivity and quality. This research highlights the major bottlenecks in upstream learning within RSPO-certified palm oil value chains in Indonesia and Thailand. Addressing such bottlenecks is a precondition to improving smallholders’ farming practices. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Increasing demand for land to ensure human food security in the future has already impelled agricultural production into marginal areas. The environmental conditions found there have a more pronounced impact on agricultural productivity than in the systems used so far under favourable conditions. In addition to this challenge, climate change is expected to increase the unreliability of weather conditions (through increased variability and occurrence of extremes) for farmers considerably. This unreliability is even more serious in developing countries’ farming system where food security is vulnerable. Current efforts in digitalization offer great possibilities to improve farmers` decision-making processes. A wide range of online tools and smartphone applications is available to support both agricultural extension services and smallholder farmers alike. These apps are often parameterized and validated to certain environments and are troubled when applied to new geographical locations and different environmental conditions. We have conducted field trials to demonstrate potential methods to close knowledge gaps in the data background for one of these apps, RiceAdvice, concerning three key aspects: shifting of cropping calendar, adjustment of fertilizer management and genotype selection. Sites in Ethiopia, Madagascar and Rwanda were selected to represent altitudinal gradients, with overlapping elevations reflecting differences in temperature to enable cross-country comparisons. Planting dates were distributed throughout three calendar years, with continuous iterative planting dates taking place in Madagascar, in- and off-season planting dates in Rwanda with different fertilizer applications, and one planting date during each rainy season in Ethiopia with different management options. With these trials, we have been able to identify key data sets needed for the adaptation of agricultural decision support tools to new environments. These include the assessment of climatic constraints on innovations to cropping calendars (e.g. double cropping), informed selection of alternative varieties able to complete crucial parts of their phenological development to avoid temperature-related stress inducing, for example spikelet sterility in rice in late development stages and the effectivity of potential innovations in fertilizer management strategies. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {A survey was conducted to identify management information sources and communication channels used by commercially oriented smallholder beef cattle producers (n = 62) in Limpopo province, South Africa. A total of 62 commercially oriented smallholder farmers under the Limpopo Industrial Development Corporation-Nguni cattle project were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data on farmers’ demographic and farm characteristics, sources of information and communication channels used. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to evaluate factors that influenced farmers’ choices of information sources and communications channels used. Findings show that government extension (53\% of the respondents) and other farmers (30\%) were the major sources of management information for the farmers. Based on the logistic regression results, the decision to choose government extension as the main source of information was mainly influenced by respondents’ gender (p = 0.001) and access to training (p = 0.023). Communication was mainly through farm-to-farm visits (56\%) and the use of mobile phones (30\%). Based on the current findings, the infusion of modern information communication technologies such as mobile phone-based innovations with the existing government extension service could further strengthen the capacity of farmers to share information among themselves as well as providing feedback to extension agents. Furthermore, it is essential to take cognizance of farmers’ socio-economic factors when identifying and characterizing their management information sources and communication strategies. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Family farms, in which business and family life are intricately interwoven, offer an interesting context for better understanding the interdependence between the family and business system. Many family farms struggle to survive, and the succession process is a key period in which the low returns on investment become evident but also the emotional attachment of the family to the farm and the willingness to transfer the business to the next generation. We take the perspective of non-succeeding siblings since they are crucial for a successful succession but their role and position in this process is far from clear. This study will help to increase our knowledge of how fairness is perceived by non-successors and of the impact of perceived (in)justice on the family business system. Design/methodology/approach: To analyze the effect on sibling relationships of an unequal outcome of the succession process, we choose the family farm context. We used interview data from multiple family members from several family farms in the Netherlands in different stages of succession. We utilized a framework based on justice theory to analyze perceptions of fairness among non-succeeding siblings. The central research question for this study is as follows: How do non-succeeding siblings perceive justice with regard to family firm succession? Findings: The acceptance of the outcomes of the succession process by non-succeeding siblings is influenced by their perception of the fairness of the process itself and decisions made by the incumbent and successor with regard to these outcomes. It seems that stakeholders who occupy multiple roles with conflicting justice perspectives handle these contradictions with the help of an overarching goal—in this study, preserving the continuity of the family farm—and by prioritizing and adjusting the justice perspectives accordingly. The findings further show that both distributive justice and procedural justice are important and interact with each other. Originality/value: Our study contributes to the literature by applying the theoretical framework of distributive and procedural justice to the context of family farm succession. This helps us to understand the position of non-succeeding siblings and their role and position in the succession process, which is important because sibling relationships have a significant impact on family harmony, with potential consequences for the business as well. © 2020, Ilse Matser, Jelle Bouma and Erik Veldhuizen.

	abstract = {Disasters result from the interactions of hazards and vulnerability conditions. Considering the perspectives of survivors of a disaster event is critical for reducing the progression of vulnerability conditions. The Mbire community in Zimbabwe is facing increasing threats from recurring high-and low-magnitude floods that manifest themselves in the disruption of livelihoods and destruction of crops and infrastructure. This study, therefore, explored the perspectives of flood survivors on vulnerability to floods and examined their vulnerability-reduction measures. Using an interpretivist approach to knowledge generation, a sample of 51 research participants provided data through interviews, a focus group discussion and field observations. Results showed that shortage of land, flood-based farming practices, poverty and climate change, amongst others, are the key drivers of the smallholder farmers' vulnerability to floods. The most affected groups of people include women, children and the elderly. To reduce their vulnerability, the smallholder farmers mainly rely on traditional flood-proofed structures built on stilts, dual home system and indigenous flood forecasting. The study proposes six policy implications to reduce vulnerability to floods. These include diversifying rural livelihoods beyond the farming sector, investment in irrigation infrastructure, increasing access to financial resources, constructing human settlements away from floodplains, enforcing environmental laws regarding flood-based farming and community education on the long-term negative impacts of recession farming. The implementation of these policy recommendations can contribute to community resilience to flood disasters. © 2020. The Authors.},

	abstract = {In flammable shrublands fire size often depends on local management. Policy and land use change can drastically alter fire regimes, affecting livelihoods, biodiversity, and carbon storage. In Ethiopia, burning of vegetation is banned, but the burn ban is more strongly enforced inside the Bale Mountains National Park. We investigated if and how policy and land use change have affected fire regimes inside/outside the park. The park was established in 1969, and both studied areas have been part of a new REDD+ project since 2013. Our hypothesis is that burnt heathland stands are nonflammable and act as fuel breaks, and hence that reduced ignition rates leads to larger fires. To quantify change we analyzed remote-sensed imagery from 10 fire-seasons between 1968 and 2017, quantifying sizes of resprouting Erica stands and recording their postfire age. To elucidate underlying mechanisms of change we interviewed 41 local smallholders. There was a five order of magnitude variation in patch size ({\textless} 0.01-{\textgreater} 1000 ha). A significant interaction was found between year and site (inside/outside park) in explaining patch size, indicating that the park establishment has affected fire size. Inside the park there was a tendency of patch size increase and outside a clear decrease. Especially the largest fires ({\textgreater} 100 ha) increased in numbers inside the park but not outside. Respondents confirmed that large fires have increased in frequency and attributed this mainly to lack of fuel breaks and the fact that fires today are ignited in a more uncontrolled manner later in the dry season. Outside the park respondents explained that fires have become smaller because of increased ignition and intensified grazing. Both situations degrade pasture and threaten Erica shrub survival. For flammable ecosystems, REDD+ fire-exclusion policies need updating, and in this case complemented with a community-based fire management program making use of the vivid local traditional fire knowledge. © 2019 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {While efforts are increasingly made to democratize research relationships, empower participants and include marginalised voices in agricultural research for development, it is acknowledged that power imbalances in knowledge creation remain integral to researcher-participant relations. Moreover, published results seldom report on the different dimensions that empowerment can encompass. This paper addresses this gap, presenting an original methodological approach for collaborating with smallholder farmers and developing an analytical framework to critically assess associated modalities of empowerment. With the intention of developing more democratic processes of knowledge production to support innovation processes, five smallholder farmer groups were invited to apply for action funds to co-develop innovations to enhance livelihoods. Employing participatory video (PV), groups applied for the grants using a ‘video proposal’. Group members collaboratively produced videos representing their problems, aims and innovation plans. Key findings around group empowerment are presented and reflected upon with regard to the different modalities of “power-to”, “power-with”, “power-within” and “power-over”. The PV proposal process proved to be a good tool for supporting farmer group capacity building and the development of competencies in relation to farmers' rural innovation projects. The process enhanced farmer groups’ “power-to” in terms of planning capacities. This fostered motivation for action and a sense of collective ownership; thus building “power-with” at the group level. The understanding of power mobilised in this paper enabled us to highlight some context-specific limitations to democratising research relationships and creating more inclusive spaces for participatory action research and rural innovation development. These are related to entrenched socio-cultural power dynamics within the groups and to possibilities to sustain the empowerment process beyond the duration of the project. Nevertheless, funding agencies and local rural development organisations could consider the method discussed in this paper as a valuable tool for assisting marginalised groups in accessing innovation funds. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We found that farmer high/low categorization of soils corresponded to soil P fertility and distance from farmer dwellings. Measures of soil P fertility also were inversely related to mycorrhizal colonization of vetch roots and directly related to the potential for P release by legume residues (C:P ratio). However, particular soil properties (texture and calcium phosphate pools) were better in explaining the response of legume biological nitrogen fixation to P addition, with maximal impacts in low-clay soils and soils with low calcium phosphates, as assessed with a dilute HCl extraction. In these conducive contexts, legume BNF increased 67 and 150\% for RP and TSP, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), with similar increases in biomass P stocks that showed promise for soil regeneration. In low-P fields, added P increased potential P release from legume residues via lower C:P ratios (p {\textless} 0.05). Percent cover of soil increased from 35\% in the control to 45 and 55\% with RP and TSP (p {\textless} 0.05), which shows potential for reduced erosion risk under P fertilization of legumes.

	abstract = {Lack of information on water use of key agroforestry species is an obstacle to understanding their influence on crop productivity. Cordia africana and Albizia coriaria are the dominant tree species of smallholder farming systems in the Mt Elgon region of Uganda and have multiple uses in agroforestry systems. This study deployed six sap flow meters on stems of three selected trees each of C. africana and A. coriaria on-farm. The objective of the study was to assess the daily water use patterns of these agroforestry tree species at different times of the year. We measured the daily sap flow of these two species using the heat ratio method over a period of 18 months. There was a significant main effect of the interaction between tree species and season on daily water use. The two species show contrasting patterns of seasonal water use across leaf shedding stages characterised by episodes of reverse flow in A. coriaria at specific periods of the year. We propose that reverse flows in A. coriaria were triggered by leaf shading while the zero flows in C. africana, which occurred during rainfall events, could have resulted from a lag phase, an indication that the two species may have different water-use strategies. Although C. africana uses 12–15 l day−1 and A. coriaria uses 20–32 l day−1 based on the study trees, C. africana generally uses 12\% more water than A. coriaria on a standardised daily basis. Albizia coriaria exhibited radial variation of sap velocities between the inner and outer thermocouples at different periods of measurement, a phenomenon worth investigating further. The leaf shedding patterns of the two trees provide an opportunity for maximising the temporal complementarities of agroforestry systems where these trees exist. This knowledge of C. africana and A. coriaria tree water use provides critical insight for developing successful long-term tree monitoring and management programs in agroforestry systems. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In August 2015, a rabies outbreak occurred in bovines in a Punjab village, India; subsequently, a farmer in the same village died of rabies in October 2015. We surveyed farmers to describe the outbreak, the demographics and rabies prophylaxis administered to householders on case farms, and farmers’ knowledge of rabies prevention and treatment. We used multiple correspondence analysis to guide investigation of associations between demographics, farm status and rabies knowledge, attitudes and practices. The number of affected bovines was unusually high; 15 cattle and buffalo died on 13 smallholder farms (attack rate 4\%). Post-exposure vaccinations were administered to 24 people (median 2 doses). Affected farms had significantly larger households and were more likely to keep their livestock outside (therefore, accessible by stray dogs), suggesting that the impact of the outbreak was disproportionally borne by households of lower socio-economic status. Primary sources of rabies information were friends and neighbours, not health authorities or media. Women who had not received formal education were less likely to have heard of rabies. Although case farm participants were more likely to have heard about rabies from a veterinarian, their knowledge and practices to prevent rabies did not reflect the level expected considering their contact with a health professional; they were more likely to believe that traditional remedies prevent rabies and less likely to tell their children to avoid playing with stray dogs than participants from other farms. This study highlights knowledge dissemination disparities that, if typical of rural locations, could obstruct attempts to eliminate canine-mediated human rabies in India. Therefore, understanding the pervasiveness and influence of traditional medical beliefs on treatment-seeking behaviour, communication structures within villages and the impact of local practices such as carcass disposal on dog populations will be essential to ensure that rabies control strategies are effective in rural India. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

	abstract = {Science should be capable of covering issues as diverse as farming systems, technology, innovation, climate change adaptation, poverty alleviation, extension, policy and practice, as they all relate to sustainable agriculture and development. Some years ago, the call for a new farming systems approach was raised to accommodate the principles of interdisciplinary, systems thinking and participatory research. Society calls for systems performance that provides stability and sustainability (SDGs!), multi-scale and territorial approaches and looks for solutions for critical issues such as employment, migration and inclusion/exclusion at the global level (World Society). We propose here a way in dealing with this complexity by addressing the mentioned problem from the communication and symbolic perspective, i.e. to consider the »object» within agricultural science but mainly observe the dedicated systems of communication. By using the concept of social systems, we can accommodate under it systems as diverse as farms, extension organizations, innovation patterns, (agricultural) sciences, policy and politics, farmer and indigenous knowledge, markets and value chains, but always in the form of communication. As such, we remain within a discipline with the potential to evolve towards a promising sub-discipline of agricultural sciences (or of sociology?). The relatively new farming approach of certified organic in combination with agroecology is relevant for family farms and small-scale entities. It depends much more on societal support for extension, technology development and policy coherence than commercial farms. Organic agriculture, with its standards, technological requirements and consumer preferences is nested in socio-economic and political networks, which makes it challenging for researchers to integrate the various components. This challenge applies particularly to countries with poorly developed institutions, weak organizations and within the context of poverty and rural exodus. We therefore use a unified approach under a single scientific system. This system observes, analyses and reports on communication aspects of involved (observed!) social systems (including networks and interactions) within the society of any given nation, including the realities of globalized markets. We are developing a case study based in Mali, in which we apply this method. The case is describing a planning process involving cotton farmers from the Sikasso region, the cotton industry, public and private extension systems, farmer organizations, local governments, the NARS (IER), FiBL, donors and the national institutions involved in climate change adaptation and food security. Various technological options of production (conventional, organic) and farming systems are available. The reflexive use of science dealing with human behavior may facilitate the pragmatic participation of researchers from various disciplines in addressing the uncertainties and opportunities that lie ahead of us and achieve the required impacts together with the practitioners. © 2019 by Gian L.

	abstract = {In Vietnam, approximately 39 million tons of rice (Oryza sativa) residues accrue every year. In this study, we quantified soil nutrient balances of paddy rice fields under different crop-residue management practices in northern Vietnam. On twelve farms, we calculated nutrient balances for the four prevalent rice-residue management practices, i.e., (1) direct incorporation of rice residues into the soil, (2) application of rice-residue compost, (3) burning of rice residues on the field, and (4) the use of rice residues as fodder for livestock. Soils under practices (1) to (3) showed a positive nutrient balance, which indicates that soil fertility can be maintained under these practices and that the amounts of chemical fertilizers can be considerably reduced. If not, there is a risk of eutrophication in the surrounding surface waterbodies. Practice (4), in contrast, resulted in a negative nutrient balance, which indicates the need for returning nutrients to the soils. From our findings we conclude that knowledge about the effects of rice-residue management practices on nutrient cycles may help to optimize the use of fertilizers, resulting in a more sustainable form of agriculture. © 2019 by the authors.},

It addresses opinions on the inclusion of climate change mitigation strategies (such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-REDD+) into cocoa production, and potential obstacles and roles of stakeholders in ensuring community acceptance of such strategies in a unique multiple land use area-the Krokosua Hills Forest Reserve. Data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency and through survey of 205 cocoa farmers were assessed with Mann-Kendall, KruskalWallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Farmers' perceptions of changes in climate were notably diverse and did not always match historic weather data, but accurately described increases in temperature and drought which are linked to cocoa productivity. Farmers appreciate the importance of tree maintenance for ecosystem services but were skeptical of financially rewarding climate change strategies which favor tree protection. Cultural practices associated with cocoa production encourage carbon release and may pose a threat to the objectives of REDD+. Farmers' experience on the land, interactions with other farmers, government extension agents and cocoa buyers all influence cocoa agroforestry practices in the area, and communication through existing entities (particularly extension agents) presents a pathway to community acceptance of climate change mitigation strategies. The study recommends reforms in REDD+ strategies to adopt flexible and participatory frameworks to facilitate adoption and acceptability due to pronounced heterogeneity in community perceptions and knowledge of climate change and related issues. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Ethiopia operates a large agricultural extension service system. However, access to extension-related knowledge, technologies and agricultural inputs is unequally distributed among smallholder farmers. Social learning is widely practiced by most farmers to cope with this unequal distribution though its practices have hardly been documented in passing on knowledge of agriculture and rural development or embedding it into the local system of knowledge production, transfer and use. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to identify the different methods of social learning, as well as their contribution to the adoption and diffusion of technologies within Ethiopia’s smallholder agricultural setting. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methods approach was used, comprising farmer and expert interviews, focus group discussions, informal individual discussions and key informant interviews. The data were documented, coded and later analyzed using SPSS and ATLAS.ti. Findings: The findings showed that 55 per cent of the farmers in the studied areas fully relied on social, community-level learning to adopt agricultural technologies, while 35 per cent of them relied on social learning only partly. Farmers acquired knowledge through social networks by means of communication, observation, collective labor groups, public meetings, socio-cultural events and group socialization. Informal institutions such as iddir, debo and dado, helped farmers learn, adopt and diffuse technologies. Originality/value: This study used the concept of epistemic oppression by Dotson (2014) as a conceptual framework to examine farmers’ access to extension services and to analyze how informal institutions serve as workplace learning for the smallholder farmers. The authors suggest community-level social learning serves as a coping mechanism against the prevailing limitations of the formal extension system, and at the same time, it guards against the deepening of social, political and epistemic inequalities that are inherent to the knowledge system. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

I draw from the case study of an agrarian village in Madagascar that was struck by a destructive category 3 cyclone. In the weeks following the storm, oral history knowledge occupied an increasingly visible role within the community, as younger farmers interacted with elders to hear tales of past storms. Through these shared accounts, people discussed specific techniques on how to cope with environmental uncertainty. They also created a sense of shared history, which provided individuals across generations an entry point into the local historical record. Overall, the process of sharing oral history accounts can contribute to community resilience, with resiliency encompassing not only technical or ecological factors, but also the more affective realms of shared legacies, hope and belonging.

While farmers have been recognized as innovation generators, many innovation studies continue to consider them as recipients or adopters of externally promoted innovations only. Based on household data from Ghana, this study, in contrast, investigates the innovation-generating behavior among rural farmers. Inspired by two innovation theories - induced innovation and innovation systems - we specifically focus on how to build the capacity of farmers to generate innovations. Controlling for selection bias, we show that participation in farmer field fora (FFF), a participatory extension approach, can play a positive role in strengthening farmers' innovation-generating capacity. Specifically, we show that FFF participants have about 27\% higher probability of generating innovations than non-participants, and FFF participation appears to increase the number of innovation-generating practices implemented by a farm household by about 49\%. However, we do not find significant spillover effects of FFF on the innovation-generating capacity of non-participants, which has implications for the cost-effectiveness of the FFF program. The results also indicate that education and risk preference are important drivers of farmers' innovations. We conclude that policies for the generation of innovations among farmers should focus on building innovation capacity through institutional arrangements that permit interactions and learning between stakeholders. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2017.},

They require various forms of organisational structures to implement them. These are the oft-forgotten links in sustainable forest management and good forest governance. This paper examines some of the major causal influences that have shaped and are shaping institutional frameworks and supporting organisations in Australia and that are likely to influence forestry employment and education. These include sometimes conflicting, sometimes complementary, influences between state and corporate forestry, industrial and smallholder forestry, in-house expertise and contracting out, regulation and certification, and decentralisation and centralisation. Because institutional change is often largely a political response to satisfy different constituents, change is likely to continue, with increasing diversity in the resulting organisations and complexity in their interactions. Competitive market processes will increasingly replace bureaucratic allocation and management wherever commercial products and services are supplied or wherever potentially commercial services can be hived off from state departments. Almost every conceivable combination now exists in the organisational structures responsible for state forestry policy, regulation, commercial timber management, reserve management, research and fire management across the different states of Australia. The greatest challenge for forestry education in Australia is whether the gulf in the mutual perceptions of the major timber management and reserve management organisations can be bridged to take advantage of the mutual concerns while acknowledging and respecting the differences. Forestry education needs revision to deal with the demands for core subjects and specialisation, the roles of kindred education courses, manageable costs, and the differing needs of polity in relation to forestry. © 2012 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

The relationship between agriculture and biodiversity has been subjected to recent questionings, both in society and in the realm of public policies, as a result of growing concerns about the environmental changes caused by anthropic action. However, despite the increase in the number of studies on family-based agriculture, and on biodiversity in Brazil, the research funding available for researching the relationship between those two broad themes is still incipient. Against this backdrop, we shall pursue two main objectives with this study: (1) to investigate how the role of family-based agriculture in the preservation of biodiversity has been approached by the social sciences in Brazil, with a focus on articles published in Brazilian scientific journals over the last 20 years that are available online; (2) to elaborate an inventory of the knowledge available on this issue in order to test a methodology for a comprehensive literature review to help decision-makers involved with public policies as it is suggested by the evidence-based policy approach. © 2011 Interdisciplinary Centre for Comparative Research in the Social Sciences and ICCR Foundation.},

	abstract = {Nigeria is endowed with underground and surface water reserves, rich pastures and favourable agroecological conditions in the country's low-lying plains with alluvial deposits, popularly referred to as fadama lands. The 3,000,000ha of fertile soils with residual moisture offer attractive opportunities for the arable farmers to grow both season and off-season high-value crops. The potential and importance of fadama agriculture for food production and economic development is crucial, given rising food prices, climatic changes, environmental risks associated with 'modern' agriculture, modelled farming systems and population growth. Fadama areas are therefore of critical importance to the survival and economic development of millions of rural dwellers. This research surveys and analyses the sustainability of fadama farming systems in semi-arid northern Nigeria. Findings reveal a delicate interaction and negotiation across the formal and informal boundaries where traditional agricultural practices, based on an understanding of the particular physical reality and exploitation of natural synergies, are combined with inputs typical of conventional agriculture. African agriculture thus stands poised at a crossroads: whether to abandon tradition in favour of entirely 'modern' methods and export markets as often advocated in certain circles or to depend on time-tested indigenous knowledge systems and grassroots-defined development vision which combines popular livelihoods with respect for nature's systems. © 2010 Earthscan.},

	abstract = {Most small farmers in remote areas like the southern highlands of Tanzania cannot link to markets. Lack of information and lack of power at the negotiating table leave them open to exploitation by other participants in the market chain. Phase 1 of the First Mile Project, implemented from June 2005 to March 2006, set out to help small farmers improve their access to markets and market information. Good communication is vital in marketing. The project encouraged people in isolated rural communities to use new information and communication technologies (ICTs), including the mobile phones that are spreading rapidly throughout Tanzania, as well as E-mail and the Internet to share local experience and learn from one another. At the heart of the project is an innovative approach called Linking Local Learners (LLL). It enables poor farmers, traders, processors, and others from rural areas to learn together how to build profitable marketing chains from producers to consumers. By encouraging smallholder farmers to use mobile phones and the Internet to collaborate and learn together, First Mile enables them to participate more equally in time-sensitive, complex marketing transactions and to take advantage of the opportunities offered by globalization.},

	abstract = {Livestock plays an important role in the sustainable livelihood of poor people of rain-fed agro-ecosystem, because of inherent risk involved in the crop farming due to uncertainty of rainfall and occurrence of recurrent droughts. They provide income and increased economic stability, and often the most important "cash crops" in small-scale mixed farming systems. Small stock acts as cash buffer and large ruminants as a capital reserve. The objectives of the present investigation were to characterize the traditional livestock production systems, identify major constraints and suggest livestock production strategies based on participatory action research. Salaha Samithi (farmer advisory committee) facilitated implementation and monitoring of various interventions, mostly in the form of observation trials-cumdemonstrations. Inadequate availability and poor quality of feed and fodder; high incidence of diseases; and inadequate knowledge on appropriate management of livestock were identified as the major problems facing smallholder farmers. To enable the rain-fed farmers for livestock development, a favorable policy environment in terms of access to micro-credit, assured market and veterinary services will have to be provided and socio-economic and technical constraints needs to be addressed. The study suggested that the participation of farmers is essential for developing and promoting the livestock interventions. Animal health camps created awareness among farmers regarding the adoption of better livestock practices like supplementation of mineral mixture in the concentrate ration and hopping of crop-residues. Through exposure visits and farmer-to-farmer interaction, many farmers realized that integration of livestock and fodder production within their limited land and water resources provides a better livelihood option in dry lands.},

Dichotomous, yes or no decisions were examined in a binary logistic regression. Farmers were asked to identify their sources of learning. Institutional and human capital variables were included to diminish other forms of bias and to identify which groups of farmers are amenable to adopting new technologies. An extension program for a region in Honduras was analysed to determine what types of farmers are responsive to new technologies and what types of training promote the adoption of those technologies. Producers of commercial crops demonstrated an increasing inclination to adopt new technologies as they increased the market proportion of their output. Subsistence farmers demonstrated a negative correlation between land extensiveness and technology adoption. Cooperative association had a positive influence on adoption. The results indicate that training and visitation extension methods have a multiplier effect through personal contacts of experts and friends and are very effective in motivating technology adoption. Mass communication media cannot be discounted and present a viable alternative. -from Authors},

A field study carried out in Benin showed that a concrete analysis of interaction between peasants and extension workers should be done in order to be able to assess the suitability of extension approaches. The contribution shows that interaction between members of an agricultural extension service and peasants can be seen as a business where different groups of peasants and extension workers barter according to their particular interests, and where extension messages by themselves may have little importance for the contract between peasants and extension workers. The consequence of extension staff intervention for peasants is an increase of socio-economic disparities, because only richer farmers can afford to claim the services offered by the extension organization. -from Author},

	abstract = {Use of mineral fertilizers is essential to enhance crop productivity in smallholder farming systems of Sub-Saharan Africa, but various studies have reported ‘non-responsiveness’ where application of inorganic fertilizers does not lead to satisfactory yield gains. This phenomenon is not well defined nor are its extent and causes well understood. In order to close these knowledge gaps, we assessed the effects of commonly recommended nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and/or potassium (K) fertilizer inputs on maize grain and soybean production on farmer fields across prevalent land slope and/or soil texture gradients (2 × 2 matrix) in four agroecosystems over two growing seasons. The extent of the problem in the two cropping systems was compared by decomposing frequency distributions into various ranges of fertilizer effect sizes that represent specific degrees of non-responsiveness and responsiveness. Key soil properties and rainfall variables for field trials were also determined to identify the factors that are limiting crop yield increases by mineral fertilizer input. Significant differences were found in mean fertilizer effect on crop productivity and frequency of non-responsiveness among the study areas and growing seasons, with some explicit contrasts between maize and soybean. The application of mineral fertilizers failed to increase maize yields by more than 0.5 t ha−1 in up to 68 \% of farmer fields and soybean yields by more than 150 kg ha−1 in up to 65 \% of farmer fields for specific study areas and/or growing seasons, while for others crop responses exceeded those levels. Unlike hypothesized, there were no consistent differences in crop fertilizer responses between the soil texture and land slope classes at any of the study sites. The variation in fertilizer effects on maize grain productivity across the study areas and growing seasons was most strongly related to the soil silt and clay content, and exchangeable cation balances of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and K, whereas fertilizer effects on soybean were most strongly influenced by the evenness in rainfall during growing seasons, and the soil silt content, extractable P, and ratio of total C and total N. Findings from our study emphasize that non-responsiveness by maize and soybean crops in African smallholder agroecosystems is dependent on multiple interacting factors, and requires careful scrutiny to ensure returns on investments. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Micro-scale perspectives are seldom included in planned climate change adaptations, yet farmers’ perceptions can provide useful insights into livelihood impacts from interactions between climatic and other stressors. This research aims to understand how climate variability and other stressors are impacting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Azamgarh district, eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Data from 84 smallholder farmers were collected using mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches, including interview and participatory methods, informed by multiple stressor and sustainable livelihood frameworks. Results revealed that farmers are increasingly facing problems caused by the reduced duration and number of rainy days, and erratic rainfall. Anomalies in seasonal cycles (longer summers, shorter winters) seem to have altered the local climate. Farmers reported that repeated drought impacts, even in years of moderate rainfall, are adversely affecting the rice crop, challenging the formal definition of drought. Climate variability, identified as the foremost stressor, often acts as a risk multiplier for ecological (e.g., soil sodicity), socio-economic (e.g., rising costs of cultivation) and political (e.g., mismatching policies and poor extension systems) stressors. In addition to climate stresses, resource-poor marginal groups in particular experienced higher risks resulting from changes in resource management regimes. This study provides an important cue to revisit the formal definitions of normal rainfall and drought, accommodating farmers’ perceptions that evenly distributed rainfall, and not total rainfall is a key determinant of crop yields. Though India has developed adaptive measures for climate change and variability, integration of farmers’ perceptions of climate and other stressors into such policies can improve the resilience of smallholder farmers, who have hitherto depended largely on autonomous adaptation strategies. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

This research examines the agroecological landscape knowledge of farmers in a recent participatory seed project using the tricot approach in Central America. Over 800 smallholder farmers in Nicaragua facilitated on-farm trials of diverse common bean varieties that are nutritiously valuable and potentially well-adapted to increased temperatures and variable precipitation. Our article integrates relevant research concepts in a case study of the agroecological landscape knowledge of 52 participating farmers. Participatory sketch maps, transect walks, and semi-structured interviews were used to identify key areas of farmers’ agroecological landscape knowledge in crop and seed management. Results indicate the prevalence of nine themes of farmer agroecological landscape knowledge. This landscape knowledge exerts major influence on the choice, placement, and management of common bean varieties and associated land use decisions. Our analysis reveals that farmers use this knowledge to manage their landholdings as landscapes of agroecological interactions that guide seed and variety management and affect potential sustainability. Results demonstrate that local agroecological landscape learning is strengthened through and benefits participatory seed projects. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

More specifically, we adopt BWS to provide an update on constraints that limit the participation of Kenyan horticultural smallholder farmers in modern agricultural value chains. In addition to traditional constraints posed by input market failures and missing institutions, we considered constraints such as trust and familiarity with buyers shown by recent empirical studies to inform smallholders’ market choices. Ascertaining the relevance of these constraints highlights our contribution to the existing literature. We find that farmers consistently rate access to high-quality inputs as their main constraint followed by concerns about access to credit, the high cost of meeting food standards, missing cooperatives, and exploitative intermediaries. Respondents considered insufficient labor, small farmlands, and weak tenure rights as the least important constraints. Age, location, gender, household income, and education influence the relative importance various segments of smallholders place on these constraints. For example, constraints are economic rather than personal for low-income farmers. Counterintuitively, rural smallholders are less likely to perceive poor transportation network as a constraint. Smallholders’ distrust of buyers they interact with is informed by their location and income. In designing intervention initiatives, policies that focus on segments of smallholders are needed for improving smallholder participation in modern agricultural value chains. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: While advances in agricultural research and development have led to generation of improved new cooking hybrid banana varieties (HBVs) with enhanced yield potential to restore production levels, these have been received with mixed feelings on production and consumption attributes among the farming communities in Uganda. Some farmers prefer HBVs that are comparable to their local varieties in terms of consumption attributes such as soft food, color when cooked, flavor and taste while others prefer high-yielding HBVs to produce surplus output for sale. Methods: Using cross-sectional survey data from 242 randomly selected smallholder banana farmers in Nakaseke and Luwero districts in Central Uganda, the study applied a Tobit regression model to analyze the influence of socio-economic factors and variety attributes on the adoption of new hybrid bananas. Results: The results on the perception of farmers on banana variety attributes showed that the new HBVs had desirable production-related attributes, while local cultivars were rated superior to hybrids on consumption-related attributes. Evidence further showed that production-related and consumption-related attributes influenced farmers' decisions in the adoption of HBVs. Further, an assessment of the socio-economic factors that influence the adoption of HBVs showed that education of the farmer, household size, interaction with different banana actors, experience (number of years growing HBVs), and source of planting materials had a significant influence on farmers' adoption of the new HBVs. Conclusion: The study findings provide insights into the need for agricultural research and development initiatives to target the development of banana varieties with multi-traits that meet end-users' preferences and needs. Facilitating the establishment of multi-actor platforms that bring together the different actors to share information and learn might be useful in increasing the intensity of HBVs adoption. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Mekong Delta's shrimp farming contributes to socio-economic development but tends to reduce the mangrove area. On the one hand, NGOs advocate balancing ecology and economy, while on the other hand, the Vietnamese government supports intensifying shrimp production. The latter strategy increases shrimp diseases and marginalises smallholders. To influence the opinions, knowledge and behaviour of shrimp farmers, we developed and tested a serious board game. Approach: Through several iterations, we designed a realistic board game mimicking local shrimp farming. Then, after conducting three sessions of gameplay with farmers in three sites, we assessed how this gameplay influenced players. We used a semi-experimental set-up by collecting data on the day of the gameplay, and on two further time-points. Findings: After the gameplays, farmers reported to have learned about the risks of monoculture-intensive-shrimp system and the advantages of hybrid systems. Likert ratings showed that players adopted innovations faster and, in case of shrimp diseases, consulted commercial service-providers less, but with other farmers more. They confirmed to have learned that the best strategy for them would be to adopt hybrid systems, i.e. intensify part of the area of mixed-mangrove or improved-extensive shrimp farms. Theoretical implications: Realistic board games can create opportunities for social learning and training of groups which are not always easy to reach. Practical implications: Board games can support transfer of knowledge and skills to farmers, and can develop their critical thinking. Creation: The findings that board games are effective in the context of a top-down extension systems offer value opportunities. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In Pakistan, due to the asymmetries in farmers’ information access, many ICT-based initiatives have been taken as an alternative to conventional agricultural extension approaches. Recently telecommunication sector of Pakistan has launched farm advisory services for reaching farmers’ information needs. This paper analyzed the telecom sector’s mobile-based farm advisory services (mFAS) by exploring, provided content, farmers’ use, experiences, and its associated factors using the Likert scale and bivariate Probit regression. The study employed a multistage random sampling technique to collect data from the smallholders of Muzaffargarh district of Pakistan. Findings revealed that 70\% of the respondents were subscribed to mFAS. Results further indicated a vast gap between the farmers’ access and practical use of provided information in which weather forecast reported the most, while market updates reported the least utilization gap. Similarly, reduced transportation cost was ranked the most, while avoiding potential crop damages was ranked as the least perceived indicators of effectiveness. The study further reported one-way communication mode and farmers’ limited skills of mobile phone use as the major constraint in the use of the services. The results of the Probit model found a significant positive relation of farmers’ education, credit utilization, and educated family members, while a significant negative relation of farmers’ age with the use of mFAS. Based on findings, this study highlights the need for an interactive communication mode, context-specific advisory services, and farmers’ training and education for the successful utilization of these services. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The bureaucratic organization of the State follows a logic of sectorial fragmentation and, like in the Academy, knowledge tends to be built according to disciplinary frames. Specialization helps to address some challenges better, but tends to be limited when dealing with complex problems that require greater integration. Sectorial public policies sometimes result in zero-sum games when they interact with other intervention axes. This study explores the idea of integrating social, economic and environmental policies towards energy, with focus on the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil. Based on the Nexus approach, which integrates water, energy and food security, and sees water as a natural resource common to these three aspects, this study proposes the production of photovoltaic energy by family farmers as a way to promote positive synergies of social, environmental and economic policies. © Instituto de Estudos Avancados da Universidade de Sao Paulo.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the successful engagement of local stakeholders in the implementation and evaluation process of improved cooking stoves; a technology that improves food security in two climatically contrasting regions in Tanzania. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment tool was used to conduct impact assessments on firewood-based improved cooking stoves to evaluate their contribution to food security at local stakeholder level. Between 2014 and 2017, four annual impact assessments were conducted with local stakeholders in four villages in the semi-arid Dodoma and the sub-humid Morogoro regions to assess the impact of improved cooking stoves on locally defined nine food security criteria. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment was used to (i) ex-ante identify the expected impact, and (ii) to ex-post assess the experienced impact of improved cooking stoves on the nine food security criteria. The impact assessments showed that the perceived contribution of improved cooking stoves towards the food security criteria was positive throughout all assessments. In particular, improved cooking stoves addressed relevant food security criteria such as social relations, food availability, and market participation. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment tool supported continuous knowledge exchange between scientists and local stakeholders, thus improving communication and co-learning; while identifying merits and demerits of the improved cooking stoves that could be addressed during the project lifetime. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Climate shocks are predicted to increase in magnitude and frequency as the climate changes, notably impacting poor and vulnerable communities across the Tropics. The urgency to better understand and improve communities' resilience is reflected in international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the multiplication of adaptation research and action programs. In turn, the need for collecting and communicating evidence on the climate resilience of communities has increasingly drawn questions concerning how to assess resilience. While empirical case studies are often used to delve into the context-specific nature of resilience, synthesizing results is essential to produce generalizable findings at the scale at which policies are designed. Yet datasets, methods and modalities that enable cross-case analyses that draw from individual local studies are still rare in climate resilience literature. We use empirical case studies on the impacts of El Nio on smallholder households from five countries to test the application of quantitative data aggregation for policy recommendation. We standardized data into an aggregated dataset to explore how key demographic factors affected the impact of climate shocks, modeled as crop loss. We find that while cross-study results partially align with the findings from the individual projects and with theory, several challenges associated with quantitative aggregation remain when examining complex, contextual and multi-dimensional concepts such as resilience. We conclude that future exercises synthesizing cross-site empirical evidence in climate resilience could accelerate research to policy impact by using mixed methods, focusing on specific landscapes or regional scales, and facilitating research through the use of shared frameworks and learning exercises. © 2019 The Author(s).

More frequent and intense extreme weather events will impact upon the ability of British farm systems to maintain or increase levels of food production. However, in this cultural context, relatively little is known about farmers' relationship with ‘the weather’, formed from their daily experiences of it. This paper engages at the farm scale to explore farmers' information-seeking behaviour about the weather, which influences their current risk perceptions of extreme weather conditions, through exploration of their assemblages of meteorological and local knowledge. Views are collected using a broad-based quantitative scoping survey combined with in-depth qualitative research with farmers located in the Welsh Marches border region of England and Wales, UK. Findings demonstrate that different types of farmer-weather relationships can be recognised depending upon the way weather and climate information is sought and utilised. We present a typology of farmer-weather relationships, categorising farmers as: analysts; intuitives; fatalists; or disengagers; with regards to the way in which they seek and interpret weather and climate information. This typology may assist the formation of new weather and climate services through an improved understanding of how lay and scientific knowledges interact in practice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Water adequacy is central to maximised agricultural production in irrigation schemes. Smallholder Irrigation Schemes (SISs) are designed to distribute water efficiently, adequately and equitably. Water governance, defined as the institutions, processes, procedures, rules and regulations involved in water management, plays an important role in water allocation and subsequently water adequacy. The intersectoral institutions involved in water governance in SISs, i.e., government, Water User Associations (WUAs), Irrigation Management Committees (IMCs) and traditional authorities, interact to formulate and design policies for running SISs. However, multilevel interaction amongst the active stakeholders at multiple levels shapes policy and underlies SIS performance. This research aimed to investigate the impacts water governance had on adequacy of water in irrigation schemes and was premised on the hypothesis that governance had no effect on water adequacy. Water adequacy describes water supply relative to demand. Adequacy indicates whether the water delivery system supplies the required amount to a section in the irrigation scheme over a period of time (daily, monthly or seasonally). Two irrigation schemes, the Mooi-River Irrigation Scheme (MRIS) and Tugela Ferry Irrigation Scheme (TFIS) were used as case studies. A descriptive analysis showed that 86\% of the farmers in the TFIS had adequate water, whereas 24\% had water adequacy in the MRIS. A Binary Logit model was employed to investigate the factors that influence water adequacy among irrigators. The regression model identified eight statistically significant factors that influenced water adequacy: the irrigation scheme, location of plot within the scheme, training in water management, training in irrigation, SIS irrigators’ knowledge about the government’s aims, availability of water licences, payment of water fees and satisfaction with the irrigation schedule. The study concluded that governance factors had influence on water adequacy in the selected SISs. The implication is that stakeholders should make irrigators aware of government Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) policy and strategies. The study recommends that the SISs introduce rules, procedures and protocols to support irrigators to enhance scheme governance and lead to the realisation of government policies. © IWA Publishing 2019.},

	abstract = {Conflict over natural resources is a widespread phenomenon in the global south. Trends in consumption, demographics, environmental degradation, and socio-political dynamics are exerting significant pressure on the availability and accessibility of natural resources. In many countries, the governance of land for commercial agricultural investment leads to conflict. Such conflicts are complex, and the drivers extend beyond resource scarcity to issues of access and competition. This paper is based on the results of field research on investments in large-scale Jatropha plantations for biofuel production in Ethiopia. A case study of a large-scale Jatropha plantation in eastern–central Ethiopia is used to reconstruct the history of a short-lived, large-scale biofuel development in Ethiopia, and to examine the processes and the reasons for its failure. Between 2006 and 2009, more than 400,000 ha of land were acquired for industrial biofuel development. Given the country’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and the global rush for alternative energy sources, the Ethiopian government, not surprisingly, gave emphasis to investment in biofuel development, mainly through Jatropha plantation. However, after costly experimentation, the “miracle crop” did not deliver what had been promised. Instead, it dispossessed and displaced thousands of marginalized local smallholder agropastoralists, created conflict over water and land resources, and kept thousands of hectares of land out of production. In the end, the rhetoric of “Jatropha revolution” and promises of local and national development were never materialized; the government’s ambitious biofuel strategy also failed to achieve its objectives. The main argument of this paper is that the failure of large-scale biofuel companies to fulfill their ambitious promises in Ethiopia is part of the general failure in the governance of large-scale commercial agriculture and misleading views toward, and unrealistic promises of, Jatropha investments. These negatively affected the livelihood of the local agropastoralists and their interactions with the companies, which caused instabilities and conflicts in the area. It is hoped that the findings of this research will contribute to knowledge production and policies on the governance of large-scale commercial agriculture. © 2018 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Agricultural extension is the main instrument for capacity building of smallholder farmers in Pakistan. Capacity building, in this study, is defined as the ability to gain knowledge and skills of recommended technologies that improve farmers’ performances. Since the early 1990s, the government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan endorsed private extension in an effort to enrich the effectiveness of public extension through competition. This research, conducted in 2016, sought to determine whether private extension providers are more effective than public extension as information sources for smallholder farmers. The specific objectives were to examine the effectiveness of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) use by public and private agricultural extension providers and to analyze statistically, the performances of public and private extension systems. A sample of 342 farmers drawn from a list of 2,365 rice growers registered with public and private offices in Gujranwala, the largest rice-producing district in Pakistan, were interviewed. The study found that extension agents in the private sector were less effective than the public sector, in communicating development messages to resource-poor farmers. However, the private sector was more effective in inputs distribution than the public sector. The authors suggest ways public and private extension workers can be more effective in strengthening the capacities of smallholder farmers. © 2018, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

Methodology: To fulfill this objective, a Delphi technique was utilized. The study used a series of three steps, engaging a panel of experts on farmer-oriented policies of agricultural extension system. Finding: The characteristics of farmer-oriented policies in agricultural extension system were classified into six categories including: need-based programs, proper interaction among stakeholders, decentralization and higher stakeholders’ participation, enabling stakeholders with emphasis on smallholder farmers, market-oriented programs and integrated policies. The findings indicated that ‘enabling farmers to solve their technical problems’ and ‘engaging farmers in planning, executing and evaluating of the programs’ had the highest percentage of agreement. Theoretical implication: From a theoretical point of view, the finding of this research has introduced six categories as characteristics of a farmer-oriented policy that could have practical implications for agricultural extension system in Iran. Also, this paper proposes a framework for future studies in the field of farmer-oriented policies in agricultural extension system. Practical implications: Recognizing the characteristics of farmer-oriented intervention of agricultural extension shows that targeted extension approaches are needed to pay attention to these characteristics in various stages of planning, delivering and evaluation of extension programs. Originality/value: This paper provides a comprehensive list of characteristics of farmer-oriented policies of agricultural extension that can be helpful for agricultural policy-makers in devising programs of extension services. © 2016 Wageningen University.},

	abstract = {Climate change threatens to derail the lives and livelihoods of farmers all over the world if appropriate adaptation measures are not put in place. Smallholder farmers, more so those in developing countries like the Philippines, are especially at risk because of inherent socio-economic characteristic and environmental factors limiting their capacity to adapt. One adaptation measure that can potentially benefit smallholder farmers is agroforestry. However limited understanding, incorrect information and a negative mindset could hinder the successful adoption of this practice. This case study of smallholder farmers in Peñablanca, Cagayan, Philippines attempts to explain the farmers’ adaptation practices by analyzing their knowledge and attitudes on climate change and agroforestry. Two sets of surveys, one on adaptation practices (n=600) and one on knowledge and attitudes (n=41) were conducted with smallholder farmers in Peñablanca. Most farmers are aware of the basic concepts of climate change (91\%) and agroforestry (84\%), specifically of the impacts of climate extremes on their farms and of the benefits of agroforestry. However this may not always translate to correct practice of agroforestry and other adaptation measures. It is recommended that information, education, and communication programs on climate change and agroforestry for farmers should present targeted information on impacts and adaptation in a way that is relatable and understandable to them. © 2018, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

Critical questions include what traits and crops are to be developed; how they can be adapted to smallholders’ ecological, social and economic contexts; which dissemination channels should be used to reach smallholders; and which policy environments will enable the greatest benefits for smallholders and the rural poor. A key question is how the voices of smallholders who have experience with or desire to use GM technologies enter the larger debate. Africa has the greatest number of smallholders and poor with the least exposure to GM crops. Because of the well-established use of GM crops in South Africa by commercial farmers, we formed a community of practice (CoP) involving smallholders, extension, researchers, non-profits and agribusiness in KwaZulu-Natal to examine the conditions under which GM crops are used by smallholders, how smallholders interact with GM technologies and what insights smallholders and other stakeholders can provide regarding these questions. One of the advantages of the CoP approach is that it brings stakeholders together in a non-hierarchical way that encourages new ways of thinking and new partnerships. Such interaction around a specific project can enhance the voice of smallholders in a variety of ways. In our project, smallholder participants have increased their knowledge and can make better decisions about GM technologies, which had been barriers for them. Notably, they have also improved their knowledge of maize production practices, accessed new practice networks, and met new researchers and resource providers. They are now being integrated into these networks in a way that should improve their livelihoods and make the wants and needs of smallholders better known. Such knowledge and experience has improved their voice in agriculture and rural development discussions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Focus group discussions and a questionnaire was used to collect data on veterinary services providers and socio-economic factors related to animal health from a sample (N= 333) smallholder livestock farmers from Gutu district of Masvingo province in Zimbabwe. Analytical techniques used were descriptive statistics, K-mean cluster analysis and Tobit regression model. Results showed that the majority of farmers (45\%) obtained services from both Community Based Animal Health Workers (CBAHWs) and Department of Veterinary Service (DVS), 25\% DVS only, 20\% used CBAHWs while 10\% did not seek any services. Further analysis showed that distance to CBAHW, distance to AHMC and employment status were significantly related to demand for CBAHWs with coefficients of -1.5, 0.7 and -10.3, respectively. The study thus concluded that CBAHW is an alternative animal health service delivery approach already practiced in smallholder farming sectors of Zimbabwe. Socio-economic factors significantly influenced the demand for CBAHW services. Given limited resources by state sponsored veterinary services, it is recommended that the CBAHWs approach should be encouraged as supplementary service provider especially in areas further DVS. These community organizations can be empowered by the state to deliver more improved services based on hygiene and modern science at a relatively low cost to farmers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Efforts to ensure participation of livestock owners in breeding programs such as performance recording, the use of village herd stocks for breeding programs have been documented as has the creation of livestock producer organizations to enhance effective participation of farmers in breeding programs. The study was conducted in southern Mali where livestock such as the N'dama cattle are endemic. We explored baseline characteristics from a household and community survey to determine the potential effects of individual, household and network characteristics on the knowledge and use of livestock breeding strategies. We assume that interaction amongst stakeholders results in transfer of knowledge between stakeholders. Results from the stakeholder analysis of the types of stakeholders present at the site level were used in the Probit and Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) models. Farmers' organisations were commonly found at the village level. However, despite the presence of these organizations across sites, they do not interact with the technical organisations as often as they should hence a lower incidence of use of livestock breeding technologies across sites. Results from the models confirm the importance of networks as key determinants to improve the adoption of breeding technologies.},

	abstract = {Many scholars have argued that rural extension and development processes need an inter disciplinary approach, one that includes contribu tions from different sciences, particularly social ones. In this context, social and community psychology have a great potential to address this topic. In spite of this potentiality, psychology has produced scarce useful contributions to rural development and to extension processes. Additionally, limited empirical support has been given to probe this po tentiality, which makes this a theoretical argument. Thus, a cross-sectional, quantitative investigation was conducted in Argentina. An incidental, non-probabilistic sample was used, which included participants from all regions of the country. Rural extension agents working in the National Institute of Agrarian Technology, the ProHuerta Program and the Under secretariat of Family Farming of the Ministry of Agriculture, Husbandry and Fisheries were surveyed via email. Local authorities of these institutions helped the res earchers to send and receive the completed surveys in different ways. The reply to the poll was voluntary. 219 completed forms (143 men and 76 women) were received, which represent 9.06\% of rural extensions working in public institutions in Argentina. The survey included socio-demo graph ic, closed questions, and open ones regarding the problems faced by rural extensions in their everyday practice and their expectations about Psychol ogy as a mean to address them. In order to analyze the open questions, different categories of analysis were built and thoroughly described to cope with ambiguous cases, which were used to categorize all replies. In this process, grounded theory and Atlas Ti software were utilized. Next, these categories were transformed into dichotomist variables, expressing the presence of the category presence of the variable and its absence, the absence of the variable. Then all variables were incorporated to SPSS software, which allowed for the quantification of the results and the study of statistical relationships between different vari ables. The most important result of this investigation is that 88\% of the Argentine rural extensionists working in the National Institute of Agrarian Technology, the ProHuerta Program and the Under secretariat of Family Farming consider that Psychol ogy cancontribute to solve at least some of the problems they face when doing rural exten sion. Interestingly, this represents a very high and unexpected percentage, given psychology is not a social science traditionally related to rural issues or settings. In consequence, it is clear that there is a potential demand for psychologists in the field of rural development processes, which is not being addressed. Additionally, the replies allowed for the description of the role psychologists should fulfill when working in this field, from rural extensions' point of view. They argue that psychologists could work with both, them and farmers. On the one hand, they could train, advice and provide with practical tools to rural extensionists. Additionally, they could take part in interdisciplinary rural extension teams. In practical terms, they could contribute in fields such as cooperative processes and group management, design and implementation of projects, understanding of small farmers' rationale, conflict resolution, lack of adoption of technologies, and scarce participation and commitment to development projects. On the other hand, psychologists also could work directly with small farmers, providing training in different topics, and managing groups, particularly in the case of participatory processes. Additionally, they could strengthen small farmers' self-esteem, a problem that rural extensionists related to passive attitudes and fatalism. To conclude, it is important to underline that, knowing this expected role, psychologists should start a dialogue with rural development agents in order to generate a shared conception of psychologist working in the field of rural extension, which includes both, psychologists' and rural extensionists' point of view.},

Farmers themselves regard rearing of indigenous chickens as a secondary activity. The birds kept under the extensive management system live by scavenging for feed around the homestead. A survey was carried out to determine the extent to which indigenous chickens received care and extension management support. Mixing with other livestock was observed in Oshana (42\%), Ohangwena (36\%), Omusati (86\%) followed by Kavango (14\%). It was also observed that there is extensive interaction between humans and their chickens, since chickens were seen scavenging all over the houses even in places where households' food is prepared. Mortalities in chicks were highest (85\%) followed by adults (40\%). There is lack of veterinary extension service in the rural areas visited and hence some farmers (14\%) opted for the use of local herbs to treat their chickens whenever they felt sick or showing signs of ill health. The majority of farmers do not treat their birds (64\%).},

	abstract = {A considerable percentage of Polish children from agricultural families are engaged by their parents in performing work activities on farms. The performance of these tasks arouses various emotional reactions in children, from the feeling of threat, fear and anxiety, to the feeling of satisfaction, being contented and proud. The subjective feeling of happiness and life satisfaction is an extremely important factor affecting the mental health and functioning of a human being. The objective of the study was to show to what extent the quality of communication between children and parents, and the level of family cohesion and adaptability according to the Circumplex Model by D. H. Olson et al., modifies children's emotional reactions associated with the tasks performed. The study covered 192 children aged 12-13, whose parents were running a family farm. Growing up in a healthy family characterised by a balanced level of cohesion, adaptability and good communication with the father and mother, favours the occurrence in children of pleasant emotions in reaction to work which they undertake on behalf of their parents on a farm. In such families, more often than in families with bad communication and dysfunctional families (disengaged, rigid), children experience satisfaction, have a feeling of deepening bonds with their parents, and the feeling of being more adult and preparing themselves well for adult life. Family characteristics which are evidence of disorders in its functioning (lack of good communication with the father, mother, lack of bonds between family members, rigid, chaos in a family) co-occur with the child experiencing unpleasant emotional states in associated with the work performed, there occur feelings of dissatisfaction, unhappiness, unpleasantness, the feeling that it would be better to learn than to work.},

Very large subsamples of farm personnel in the National Household Sample Surveys of 1973, 1982, and 1988 provided the data. OLS regression showed large effects of each additional year of education and of labor force experience for the subsample as a whole. Five farm social classes were identified using a combination of class analysis and labor market segmentation criteria. They are Large Farmers (LF), Farm Managers (FM), Family Farmers (FF), Legally Protected (skilled) Farm Laborers (PFL), and Unprotected (unskilled) Farm Laborers (UFL). With or without taking into account the interactions of education and of years of job experience, the estimated earnings gains (EEG) (over those of the UFL class) to LF were found to be very large and increasing over the 15-year period. The EEGs of the FM class were also quite large and increasing over the period. Those of the FF fell. The EEG of the PFL class was moderately high; and it too rose. The class composition also changed. The estimated size of the LF class fell from 6 to 3\%. That of the FM class remained small at about 1\%. The PFL gained from 3 to 7\%, while that of the other two classes remained trendless - FF 32-30-32\% and UFL 58-57-60\%. It would appear the Brazilian farm social class structures moved toward a form of a Weberian ideal type of the capitalist system as large properties and their owners became more concentrated and the participation of more skilled laborers increased; and as the returns to education and experience increased, especially for large farmers, farm managers, and legally protected farm (skilled) laborers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper, based on a research realised in West Amazon and Northeast Argentina, aims at incorporating in the analysis the construction processes of the territory, particularly the social and technical practices of farmers that make possible the day-to-day life in these areas of settlement and the exploitation of their resources. The objective is to help conceiving development interventions fostering sustainable family and better articulated with the farmers capacities for action. Through localised case studies, we are studying social groups and knowledge that do and undo territory. Despite recent settlement, the analysis of local social links through kinship networks, technical dialogue networks and economics relationships between farmers, bring to the fore the existence of a local level of organisation of family. The empathic representation of local knowledge about land management shows the existence of a farmer's technical logic and rhetoric, locally coherent very dynamic and diverse, from one place to another. Even the study of the social integration between farmers of development interventions put in evidence a local ability to connect with external sources of information, power and resources, although in a clientelist way. This local level, including its functional relationships with far away actors (bank, sellers, extension workers, urban residents, etc.), appears as essential for all intervention aiming at profesionnalization and stabilisation of family farms through negotiated development and technical advising. In conclusion we analyse the different levels of co-ordination of actions where an articulation between extension workers and farmers can take place as concerns land management practices, i.e. the levels of voluntary territorial construction. © 2001 © Editions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

	abstract = {This paper presents the background and the theoretical framework of a study carried out in Israel in new immigrants' smallholders' cooperative villages (the Moshavim). The aim of the study has been to analyse processes of mutual social change and acculturation resulting from the confrontation of the Moshav with various population types. For this purpose, the economic, social, ideological and organizational norms and conditions of the Moshav are first examined in detail, and then related to relevant characteristics of the different settler groups. These characteristics are spelled out in three broad factors. A. The basic socio‐cultural predispositions of the settlers, embedded in the nature of the family, the economy, the society, the polity, and the values of the country of origin. In order to classify the settlers in respect to these characteristics, and to predict their adjustment to the Moshav, a modified concept of the traditional‐modern continuum is employed. B. Socio‐dynamic predispositions, cutting across this continuum and determining the ability to change. Here attention is paid to such factors as stability of primary groups, security of status, and structure of leadership elite in the communities of origin. C. Cultural‐dynamic predispositions – chiefly the power of analytical thinking, generalisation and abstraction – affecting learning ability and the capacity for understanding new social situations. Finally, the settlement process itself is considered, as regards such factors as selection of settlers, communication, rate of development, etc. Cet article fournit les bases et le cadre théorique d'une étude menée en Israel sur les villages coopératifs de petits exploitants récemment immigrés (Moshavim). Le but de l'étude a été l'analyse du processus de changement social réciproque et de l'acculturation résultant de la réaction vis à vis du Moshav des divers types de population. Dans cet objectif, les normes économiques sociales, idéologiques et organisationnelles et autres caractéristiques de Moshav sont d'abord examinées en détail et ensuite rapportées aux caractères pertinents des divers groupes de colons. Ces caractéristiques sont exprimées en fonction de trois facteurs: A. Les prédispositions fondamentales des colons au point de vue socio‐culturel contenu dans la nature familiale, l'économie, la société, la politique et les valeurs du pays d'origine. De manière à classer les colons en regard de ces caractéristiques et à prévoir leur ajustement au Moshav, un concept modifié du continuum »traditionnel‐moderne« est employé. B. Les prédispositions socio‐dynamiques intervenant dans le continuum et déterminant l'aptitude au changement. Ici l'attention est attirée sur des facteurs tels que la stabilité des groupes primaires, sécurité des statuts et structure de l'élite dirigeante dans les communautés d'origine. C. Prédispositions dans le domaine culturel, principalement la capacité d'analyse, de généralisation et d'abstraction influençant l'aptitude à apprendre et la compréhension des situations sociales nouvelles. Enfin le processus de colonisation en lui‐même est envisagé en fonction des facteurs tels que sélection des colons, communication, taux de croissance, etc. Der vorliegende Beitrag befaßt sich mit dem Hintergrund und dem theoretischen Rahmen einer Untersuchung, die in Israel in kleinbäuerlichen Genossenschaftsdörfern mit Neueinwanderern(Moshavim) durchgeführt wurde. Das Ziel der Studie war, den Prozeß des wechselseitigen sozialen Wandels und der Akkulturation als Ergebnis der Gegen‐überstellung des Moshav mit verschiedenen Bevölkerungstypen zu analysieren. Zu diesem Zweck werden zunächst die ökonomischen, sozialen, ideologischen und institutionellen Normen und Verhaältnisse des Moshav im einzelnen untersucht und dann zu relevanten Merkmalen verschiedener Siedlergruppen in Beziehung gesetzet. Diese Merkmale gliedern sich in drei große Faktorengruppen: A. Die sozio‐kulturellen Grundanschauungen der Siedler, die sich aus dem Wesen von Familie, Wirtschaft, Gesellschaft, Verfassung und den Wertvorstellungen im Ursprungsland ergeben. Um die Siedler im Hinblick auf diese Merkmale einzuordnen und ihre Anpassungsfähigkeit an das Moshav zu beurteilen, wird ein modinziertes Konzept des Kontinuums “traditional‐modern” verwendet. B. Die sozio‐dynamischcn Anlagen, die über dieses Kontinuum hinweg die Fähigkeit zum Wandel bestimmen. Dabei werden Faktoren, wie Stabilität von Primärgruppen, Sicherheit des Status und Struktur der Elite in den Herkunftsgemeinden beräcksichtigt. C. Kulturell‐dynamische Eigenschaften – besonders die Fähigkeit, zum analytischen Denken, zur Verallgemeinerung und Abstraktion –, die die Fähigkeit zum Lernen und zum Verstehen neuer sozialer Situationen beeinflussen. Schließlich wird der Siedlungs‐prozeß selbst beobachtet, soweit es Faktoren wie Auswahl der Siedler, Kommunikation, Entwicklungsgrad usw, betrifft. Copyright © 1964, Wiley Blackwell.

	abstract = {Newcastle disease (ND) poses a challenge especially for farmers rearing indigenous chicken under the extensive system. This is due to the lack of uniformity in practices, favoring the introduction and spread of the disease. This is worsened by the lack of information on how management practices contribute to the spread of ND. The current study assessed the role of extensive chicken production systems and management practices on the frequency of ND outbreaks in Kenya using a Poisson regression model (PRM) on primary survey data from 332 farmers in Kakamega and Machakos counties. Descriptive results showed a low access to institutional support services like extension, training, credit, and vaccination services for both male and female farmers. Results from the PRM analysis show that flock size, isolated and confined housing, multi-aged flock mixture, screening of birds, access to ND vaccination, ND awareness, distance to agro-veterinary service providers, and access to animal health training and extension services had significant effects on the frequency of ND outbreaks. The findings underscore the need for innovative extension approaches that facilitate the use of information communication technologies to create more awareness on disease detection and mitigation measures. Use of farmer groups as innovation platforms for enhanced skill sharing and as key peer monitoring channels would also improve compliance with prescribed disease control methods. Further, there is a need for partnerships between local-level county governments, vaccine producers, and agro-veterinary service providers to ensure the development of low-cost vaccines and requisite storage facilities, and their timely delivery to the male and female resource-poor smallholder extensive chicken farmers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Despite concerted efforts, achieving the goal of universal food security remains challenging. Food security interventions occur at different levels of systemic depth. Some interventions target visible supply-side gaps, while others focus on deeper systemic problems in the food system. Here, we used a leverage points perspective to ask how multiple types of more superficial (shallow) and more fundamental (deep) interventions in the food system interact. Focusing on a case study in southwestern Ethiopia, we examined (1) recent changes in formal and informal institutions related to food security; (2) the effects of formal and informal institutions on the food system at different levels of systemic depth (i.e., on parameters, feedbacks, design, and intent); and (3) issues of institutional interplay between formal and informal institutions. We surveyed 150 rural households and analyzed key policy documents. Both formal and informal institutions were perceived to improve food security. However, at the intent level, formal institutions primarily aimed to enhance food supply, while informal institutions additionally sought to build trust among farmers. At the design level, formal interventions targeted information flow through a newly created agricultural extension system, while informal institutions facilitated labor sharing and communication. In terms of institutional interplay, new formal institutions had partly undermined pre-existing informal institutions. We conclude that both visible supply-side gaps and deeper drivers of food insecurity should be targeted through food security interventions. Interventions need to be cognizant of potentially unexpected ways of institutional interplay, especially between formal and informal institutions. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Inclusive innovation as a strategy for inclusive development has received increased attention from development policymakers, practitioners, and scholars in recent years. What these processes entail in practical terms, however, remains contested and under-theorized. This paper addresses the scarcity of mid-level analysis and models of inclusive innovation processes within complex systems, which are needed to enable a coherent empirical research agenda and to inform program theory-building, implementation, and evaluation. Looking to smallholder-oriented agricultural systems in the Global South, where the majority of inclusive innovation implementation and research has been located, this paper proposes that it is possible to identify the essential features and causal logic of these processes to create an empirically-derived, middle-range model with cross-context applicability. Drawing on methods from realist evaluation and social inquiry, I conducted a theory-driven, cross-case synthesis of three studies of inclusive innovation processes in agricultural systems, with one case each from South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. I find that despite significant diversity in project designs, facilitation approaches, and local contexts, the three inclusive innovation processes unfolded in strikingly similar ways, and that this modus operandi can be modeled as a middle-range theory of change. In each case, I find that a consistent set of activities and processes changed the local context for the inclusive innovation initiative. These altered contextual factors interacted with ongoing programmatic activities in consistent ways to trigger processes of social learning, social capital strengthening, collective cognition, and consensus formation, which acted as causal mechanisms responsible for producing the intermediate outcomes that led to technical, organizational, and institutional system innovation. The middle-range model enables cross-context insights into how inclusive innovation processes work and what capacities are needed to facilitate them. It can also guide the adaptive management and assessment of these processes, while offering testable hypotheses to guide future empirical work and evaluation. © 2021 The Author},

	abstract = {Mobile phone applications (apps) designed to assist smallholder farmers improve decision-making have been revolutionizing the agriculture sector. These apps offer solutions to farmer information needs by providing weather information, crop market trends, pest and disease damage identification, and advice on pesticide and fertilizer use. They also facilitate interaction with fellow farmers, extension workers and other stakeholders in the value chain who are interested in information exchange. Much previous research has investigated the contribution of mobile apps to agricultural production. This study explored the agricultural mobile apps available in Myanmar, analyzed factors affecting their use and assessed the potential for farm-based decision support. Our findings indicate that when introducing mobile-based tools, focus should be given to younger, more educated farmers growing more specialized crops. The main constraints to adopt agricultural apps are lack of access to smartphone and/or internet (63\%) and lack of digital knowledge (20\%). However, smallholder farmers in Myanmar were optimistic and positive toward agricultural apps for effective utilization. We also found that majority of the surveyed farmers were familiar with information received through Facebook groups. Incorporating useful information and functions from an agricultural mobile app to a Facebook Page could have a more useful and sustainable impact. © 2020 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

This paper analyzes the factors influencing the probability and intensity of adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices in Ghana, and identify the possible combinations of ISFM practices used by farmers based on their perceptions of climate variability and shocks. The empirical results revealed that demographic, farm-related variables, land quality, institutional factors, relative isolation, and recent experience of climate variability and shocks influence the probability and intensity of ISFM adoption. Perceptions of climate variability and shocks have a heterogeneous effect on the adoption of multiple ISFM practices. Farmers exposed to precipitation shocks are more likely to complement mulch with residue as an adaptive response to evapotranspiration while substitute mulch with mineral fertilizer. The results highlight the risk-averse decisions and mitigation strategies employed by farmers. Providing adequate and timely climate information to farmers will mitigate the biases related to the perception of climate variability and subsequently improve soil fertility choice. Strengthening the farmer-research-extension linkages coupled with communication of “better fit” ISFM practices will increase adoption. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The importance of extension services in helping smallholder farmers to address the many challenges of agricultural production cannot be over-emphasized. However, relatively few studies have been conducted that investigate how the capacities of agricultural extension agents can be built to more effectively assist smallholder farmers in managing climate risks and impacts. As climate change is a key threat to smallholder food production, addressing this issue is increasingly important. This paper aims to identify how agricultural extension agents in Ghana can better support smallholder farmers in navigating and addressing the effects of climate change on food production. It asks: (i) what are the sources of information used by agricultural extension agents in Ghana's Upper East region? (ii) what are the capacity building needs of agricultural extension agents for effective communication of climate information for building resilient agricultural systems? (iii) what are the key barriers to successful extension outcomes for climate change adaptation? The paper uses a mixed methods approach including three regional stakeholder workshops, expert interviews and surveys with 32 agricultural extension agents in northeastern Ghana. Results addressing question (i) indicated that radios and television are the dominant sources of climate information for agricultural extension agents in the Upper East region. Findings targeting question (ii) identified capacity building needs such as developing extension agents’ technical skills, improving communication skills, improving knowledge and use of climate smart agricultural interventions such as soil moisture conservation methods, and training on information communication technologies (ICT) to deliver extension advice on climate change. Other needs included developing skills in field demonstration and project monitoring and evaluation. Addressing question (iii), key barriers confronted by agricultural extension agents in the delivery of extension on climate change included lack of transportation facilities for extension agents, lack of appropriate extension materials, high agricultural extension agent to farmer ratios, and inadequate funds to implement adaptation practices. Wider barriers reducing the effectiveness of extension efforts included farmer resistance to change and complex land tenure arrangements that do not allow investment. Periodic workshops should be organised for agricultural extension agents on the use of ICT to deliver extension services, whilst encouraging the use of audio-visuals in extension delivery. These efforts should be supported by regular assessments of extension agents’ capacity building needs. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The development of Sub-Saharan Africa will become increasingly constrained by the acute climate sensitivity of livelihood practices. Weather and climate services can improve climate risks to development by informing plans and decisions that ultimately reduce losses/maximize beneficial opportunities from climate variability and change. Yet, such services are typically highly aggregated, and notoriously difficult to communicate, especially to smallholder farmers and pastoralists where the need is greatest. Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) are decentralizing service provision, and in so doing, offering disaggregated, contextualized, and more easily understandable localized weather and seasonal information products relative to national level equivalents. This article uses household productive income (2014–2015) across Kitui County to model the economic value of KMD’s local seasonal forecast and advisory products. The findings suggest that, after controlling for alternative explanations, households receiving KMD’s local advisories and seasonal forecasts have marginally higher income levels compared to the counterfactual of using national level equivalents. When marginal appreciations in productive income are compared to the costs of establishing and maintaining KMD’s decentralized provision, the investment is economically viable and comparable with similar initiatives within and outside Kenya. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Middlemen have good knowledge of working conditions of markets and have access to agricultural market information. Due to poor access to markets and agricultural market information by smallholders, there is a feeling that middlemen benefit more while farmers sell their crops. Good access to markets and market information may help farmers bypass middlemen while selling crops and thus benefit more. Thus, it is best to improve the informational capabilities (ICs) of farmers in agricultural marketing. Thus, this research measured ICs of farmers accessing market information, through a program NINAYO, while selling their crops. The research utilized the informational, psychological, social, and economic dimensions of the empowerment framework in identifying capability indicators to formulate survey questions. Data were collected from smallholders in six regions in Tanzania. The analysis utilized measures of life satisfaction and results showed that about half of the variation in the dependent variable, satisfaction with capabilities, was explained by the model. Backward elimination analysis confirmed that life satisfaction is multidimensional. Robustness test confirmed a positive relationship between satisfaction and capabilities. Overall, results confirmed ICs are multidimensions, their improvement empowers farmers in agricultural marketing. © 2020 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

Despite this, local institutional actors (LIAs)’ role has not been documented as a potential entry point to address poor performance and hence increase SISs’ sustainability. This study sought to assess the role of LIAs on the performance of the Tshiombo irrigation scheme (TIS). Structured questionnaires, key informant interviews (KIIs), and focus group discussions (FDGs) were used for data collection. Yield data for sweet potato, the main crop grown in the scheme, was measured as a proxy indicator for performance. Ordinary least square regression model was used to assess the relationship between LIAs and scheme performance after reducing the data using principal component analysis. The study revealed that institutional factors such as community credit support, academic extension support, academic institution market and input support, community maintenance support, and community input support positively and significantly (at 5\% level) improved the yield by a margin of 0.49, 0.12, 0.1, 0.36, and 0.10. Assessing institutional actors’ interaction within each scheme will help develop linkages that will enable sustainability of irrigation schemes.

	abstract = {Historically the dominant farming culture in Western developed countries, such as Scotland and New Zealand, has been based on maximising food production and maintaining the family business. However, this culture of production and family is under pressure from societal calls to increase the uptake of environmental practices in farm management. The pressure is leading farmers to adopt environmental practices, which causes a clash with the beliefs and values underlying the culture of production and family business. This clash is problematic, as it might form a barrier to sustained environmental change, for which not only practice change is required, but also a change in beliefs and values guiding the farming culture. This study explores the clash using an institutional perspective to: i) analyse how farmer practices, beliefs and values change due to external pressure to adopt environmental practices; ii) identify mechanisms via which this change unfolds; and iii) understand the role of participatory extension programmes in this change. An institutional perspective enables this study to move beyond the role of individual's attitudes and behaviours in adoption of environmental practices, towards considering how farmers' practices, beliefs and values together constitute the culture of farming, and how these are shaped by societal and institutional mechanisms. Twenty Scottish and 52 New Zealand farmers participated in qualitative, open-ended interviews and were observed during discussion groups or advisory meetings. Our findings show that all farmers are guided by a ‘business’, ‘lifestyle’ and/or ‘learning’ logic. The institutional clash influenced practices underlying the business logic to change from being purely based on maximising productivity, to including environmental aspects. However, no change in values was observed. Participatory extension programmes influenced practices, beliefs and values underlying the learning logic (changing from a ‘linear’ to ‘multi-actor’ logic) and thus can help facilitate more effective practice change by providing support via micro-mechanisms and enabling dynamics. The study contributes to current literature by introducing a new lens for understanding change induced by participatory extension programmes and by providing change agents, such as extensionists, with more in-depth knowledge about the main logics guiding the culture of farming, and the mechanisms by which farmer practices, beliefs and values may change. The in depth-knowledge will help to communicate, frame and organise extension initiatives. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Understanding broiler farmers' intention toward highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) control is important to design successful HPAI control programs. We used Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to identify factors (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) associated with the intentions of Western-Java small-scale broiler farmers toward implementing cleaning and disinfection (C\&D), vaccination, reporting, and stamping-out without or with 50\% compensation. For this, 203 Western-Java farmers were interviewed. The majority of the farmers had a positive intention to implement C\&D (89\%), reporting (88\%), and vaccination (80\%). A lower number had a positive intention to join stamping-out both with 50\% compensation (67\%) and without any compensation (53\%). Farmers had a more positive attitude and subjective norm, but lower perceived behavioral control toward one or more of the intentions to implement measures. Attitude was positively associated with intentions to implement C\&D and vaccination. Subjective norm of veterinarians of integrated companies was positively associated with intentions to implement vaccination. Perceived behavioral control (i.e., money and time) was positively associated with intentions to implement C\&D, vaccination, and stamping-out without any compensation. Results suggest that farmers are in favor of implementing preventive measures (i.e., C\&D and vaccination) on HPAI control over facing the consequences of control measures (i.e., stamping-out), and HPAI control programs should primarily focus on incentivizing farmers complemented by programs aiming to improve farmers' attitude. Thus, policy should be emphasized to preventive measures rather than control measures. Financial incentive-based instruments (e.g., price and performance bonus) can be used to increase the intention of farmers to implement C\&D and vaccination. Trained vaccinators might help to save the time needed to vaccinate the entire flock can increase the intention of farmers to vaccinate their chickens. Also, informational instruments (e.g., education and communication) can be used to change and to improve the attitude of farmers to implement both measures. © Copyright © 2020 Pramuwidyatama, Hogeveen and Saatkamp.},

Farmer-preferred and efficient strategies were identified through participatory modelling. The farmers' basin irrigation and scheduling (I), farmers' scheduling with furrow strategy (II), farmers' scheduling with alternate furrow strategy (III) and scheduling at 55\% maximum allowable depletion (MAD) (IV) were evaluated for maize (Zea mais) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) using the FAO AquaCrop model. The results showed that I resulted in over-irrigation for maize and under-irrigation for barley, while IV resulted in maximum yield (8.6 t ha-1 for maize and 2 t ha-1 for barley) with maximum (1.8 kg m-3) and minimum (0.8 kg m-3) water productivity of maize under IV and I, respectively. A shift from I to IV (most preferred strategy by farmers) can save 8440 mm of water, which can possibly bring back 18.5 ha of land into irrigation. It is essential to interact with farmers on a basis of mutual comprehension to increase their trust and to lay a base for discussion, awareness raising and decision making.

	abstract = {Transdisciplinary sustainability research (TDR) is characterised by methodologies that support a rich and direct interaction between academics and other societal stakeholders. However, it is not to be taken for granted that societal stakeholders are interested in collaboration, or that researchers have the skills to put participative methods into action. While there are several frameworks available to evaluate transdisciplinary research, the quality of participants’ engagement is often neglected during evaluations. The aim of this paper is to empirically assess the intrinsic motivation of participating societal stakeholders to engage in TDR by pairing Self-Determination Theory with Poggi's conceptual analysis of enthusiasm. We argue that the quality of collaboration between academic and other societal stakeholders is reflected by the latter's enthusiasm to participate, and that this supports the co-creation of outputs that societal stakeholders can put into practice. Two smallholder dairy farmer groups in Nakuru County, Kenya, reflected on their engagement in a collaborative learning process (CLP) that started in 2013. The goal of the collaboration was to co-develop contextualized innovations. We found that giving more voice and increasing representation and power of farmers in the research process sparked their enthusiasm, while a sense of progress and success sustained it. The strengthened sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness associated with intrinsic motivation helped participants invest in co-creating research outputs that have direct effects on their production systems. Especially for agricultural research for development spanning between Global North and Global South contexts, sensitivity to encouraging participants’ intrinsic motivation can contribute towards decolonizing research methodologies and shifting more power towards the societal stakeholders that these projects are meant to serve. We conclude that assessing participants’ intrinsic motivation and enthusiasm helps to determine the quality of collaboration. A possible implication could also be the differentiation between methodological approaches employed in TDR that deeply engage societal stakeholders for knowledge integration and co-production, and those that do so only at a superficial level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Vegetable production is mainly practiced by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia and it is their main source of income, employment opportunities and improving food security. Although farmers are producing more surplus vegetables, they are not much linked with markets and thus their opportunity to diversify their livelihoods from vegetable production is very much limited. Thus, this study was required to identify factors affecting market participation among smallholder vegetable farmers in southwest Ethiopia. To get the sample respondents two-stage sampling procedures were employed and finally, 240 vegetable producers were selected. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from primary and secondary sources. To achieve the stated objective probit model was used and its result indicates that age of household head, household family size, education level of household head, labour market, market information and distance from the market place were statistically influencing market participation among smallholder vegetable producers. To enable smallholder’s participation in vegetable marketing government interventions is needed to strengthening institutional service, communication and infrastructure facilities. This study may be valuable input for smallholder farmers, policymakers and other stakeholders in revealing the gab in the performance of the current vegetable production system to realize the national development policy. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this article, agent-based modelling has been applied to study the chances of dairy farmers increasing annual milk yield by learning better farming strategies from each other. Two sets of strategies were considered; in one set (S), each farmer agent would possess a number of farming strategies based on their knowledge, and in a second set (Formula presented.), farmer agents would possess farming strategies that they have adopted from their peers. Regression models were used to determine litres of milk that could be produced whenever new strategies were applied. By using data from Ethiopia and Tanzania, 28 and 25 determinants for increase in milk yield were fitted for the two countries, respectively. There was a significant increase in average milk yield as the farmer agents interacted and updated their (Formula presented.) – from baseline data, average milk yield of 12.7 ± 4.89 and 13.62 ± 4.47 to simulated milk yield average of 17.57 ± 0.72 and 20.34 ± 1.16 for Tanzania and Ethiopia, respectively. The peer-to-peer learning approach details an inexpensive method manageable by the farmers themselves. Its implementation could range from physical farmer groups to online interactions. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {This article explores how conflict-induced displacement influences agricultural innovation processes and systems, and its implications after the return home or permanent resettlement of smallholder farmers. Results show that high rates of agricultural innovation occurred during displacement in the Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005), many of which were maintained afterwards. Respondents cited the need for adaptation to new social and physical circumstances, changed gender roles, and enhanced inter-household communication as contributing to increased opportunities for knowledge exchange, trade, and importantly, the development of new networks, modes of organisation and social norms. Furthermore, returnees to South Sudan have embodied these changes together with new values, habits and expectations. New linkages continued across borders between returnees and non-returnees, facilitating knowledge exchange and access to resources, markets and sources of ideas. A high degree of autonomous innovation capacity was also evident. Further research is required on the dynamics and processes associated with innovation in conflict-induced displacement. It is important for policy makers to encourage approaches that seek to actively tap into and build on the institutional, human and social capital built during displacement. © 2019},

Yet, as an untraditional and unfamiliar crop, soybean requires small farmers to move beyond their traditional production practices and marketing arrangements in order to produce a successful crop. We employ complexity theory to frame soybean's production and market differences as significant and non-incremental for smallholder farmers, thus making soybean a 'long-jump' agricultural technology problem. We consider three estimation strategies using a primary dataset of smallholder women soybean producers in the Upper West region of Ghana. We first employ probit and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to understand adoption and performance. We then employ a combined spatial-autoregressive with spatial-autoregressive disturbances (SARAR) model using generalised spatial two-stage least squares to understand cross-unit interactions in a spatial dimension. We find positive, large and significant spatial autoregressive dependence and knowledge spillover to affect the soybean yields of smallholder female farmers within spatial networks. This finding provides guidance for agricultural development practitioners regarding the importance of social interaction and information provision when promoting long-jump technologies like soybean. © 2019 by the authers.},

Diets with adequate crude protein are necessary to support calf growth. The study objective was to determine the effects of nutritional advice and diet supplementation with Calliandra calothyrsus and Sesbania sesban on average daily weight gain in dairy calves on semi-commercial smallholder dairy farms in Kenya. This trial involved 155 calves from 73 smallholder dairy farms, in Kenya, randomly selected and allocated to either intervention or control groups. The intervention group received nutritional advice and seedlings of Calliandra calothyrsus and Sesbania sesban, while the control group did not receive these interventions. Every 1–2 months for 16 months, data on farm nutritional practices and management were collected in a questionnaire, and physical examinations were done to monitor weight and health status. Descriptive and univariable statistical analyses were conducted, and multivariable mixed linear regression models were used for identification of factors associated (P {\textless} 0.05) with the natural log transformation of weight gain of calves on a given farm, controlling for clustering of visits within calves. Feeding at least 0.2 kg/day (wet weight) of Calliandra or Sesbania to calves {\textless}6 months old resulted in 33.2\% increase in daily weight gain, while controlling for confounding by breed and sex of the calf. For calves ≥6 months, there was a significant interaction between amount of hay fed and if calves were also fed on Calliandra or Sesbania. When no Calliandra or Sesbania supplementation was provided, the mean weight gain was low and relatively constant even with increasing amounts of hay. When Calliandra or Sesbania supplement was added to the diet, the mean weight gain increased from 0.17 kg to 0.48 kg when hay was fed at 1 and 5 kg, respectively, while controlling for confounding by amount of maize silage fed and the prevailing season. In conclusion, supplementation of calf diets with at least 0.2 kg/calf/day of Calliandra or Sesbania is beneficial for faster weight gains. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

To promote the interest of farmers in adopting pest control services for cleaner production, the preference of farmers for pest control firms must be determined. Based on a survey of 433 grain family farms in the Huang-huai-hai Plain and using the choice experiment method, this study eliminates the ordering effect through prior “warm-up” and “disclosure” and uses inferred attribute non-attendance to process information on the attributes of for-profit pest control firms that were neglected by grain family farms. The hierarchical Bayes generalized mixed logit model was used to examine the preference for for-profit pest control firms by grain family farms. The results indicate that grain family farms prefer to adopt pest control services and select for-profit pest control firms that satisfy their requirements (the coefficient of alternative specific constant, −0.627, is significant and negative). Grain family farms are heterogeneous in their preferences of for-profit pest control firms, and they particularly prefer those provide yield commitment, with high service efficiency, and allow payment delayed (the values of the mean coefficients are all greater than 1.0). Under the same combination of for-profit pest control firms attributes, the increase in profit per mu for grain family farms with highly educated farmers, who mainly plant rice and highly acknowledge the value of pest control services and the danger of chemical pesticides can possibly increase further (all interaction terms of alternative specific constant, i.e., −0.394, 0.381, −0.453, −0.779, −0.431 and −0.428, are significant). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The study involved a sample survey of farmers, and in-depth interviews with farmers, extension officers and other government staff, and leaders of farmer associations. This particular paper explores two themes that emerged in the course of the larger study: first, what is popularly known in South Africa and elsewhere as the “culture of dependency and entitlement”, and second, the forms of support that government chooses to offer to small-scale farmers. The paper argues that government is stuck in a vicious cycle whereby it seeks to placate expectant small-scale farmers with material support, which it can most effectively do via problematic group projects; although generally ineffective, the practice has the effect of maintaining widespread demand for such support, even to the point that small-scale farmers form group projects for the sole purpose of attracting it. In seeking to compensate for the weaknesses of this approach, government has sought to introduce compensatory measures such as “strategic partnerships”, sometimes with the ironic consequence that small-scale farmers no longer play a role in farming in “their” agricultural projects. The paper concludes that the government in the Eastern Cape needs to return to the basics of effective extension support aimed at supporting individual farmers; to the extent material support is still needed, it should no longer be given away for free. © 2019, © 2019 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.},

The definition of indicators and assessment ranges were performed jointly with the peasants (men and women) through various participative methodologies. Results for the agroecological system point out a greater diversity of crops, higher percentage of crop diversity and seed self-production, higher total revenues and less seasonality of such incomes, less dependence on external inputs, higher percentage of recycling/reuse of on-farm resources/waste, greater application of own knowledge and abilities, increased application of agro-ecological technologies and greater participation in decision-making by women.

	abstract = {Land use transformation at the farm level is attributed to household decision-making, reflected by the behavior and activities of smallholder farmers. Unfortunately, household decision-making in local communities and its determinants are site-specific and hardly understood. This study uses multistage purposive selection of households as a unit for the analysis to investigate the transformation from pure agriculture to farm forest mosaics, especially through woodlot establishment. We use key informants, household surveys, and observations to obtain data on decision-making amongst 84 farm households in Nyantonzi parish, Masindi district, Uganda, as an example. Specifically, the study addresses four research questions. Firstly, what is the current status of gender-based decision-making at the household level? Secondly, is decision making within farm households individualistic or collective? Thirdly, which factors are considered to select annual, perennial and tree-crop farm management regimes? Fourthly, what determinants influence the decision-making process and the likelihood ofwoodlot establishment? A multilevel analysis comprising parametric statistical models and binary logistic regression is applied to assess difference in household natural, physical, human, and social capital, highlight gender roles, and obtain factors associated to selection of crops and determinants of woodlot establishment at the farm level, respectively. Results reveal that gender based decision-making is clearly disaggregated on the basis of husbands and wives and it is individualistic, mostly dominated by husbands with lower participation by wives and other family members. Households consider various factors before making any decisions, e.g., market prices for both annual and perennial crops, food consumption for annual crops, ease of management, and yields from the previous season for the tree-crop management regimes. The likelihood for woodlot establishment is positively influenced by the willingness and intention of households to establish woodlots and relative age of household head. However, knowledge of land use Policies, Laws, and Regulations (PLRs) in relation to tree planting and harvesting and access to non-farm income reduce the likelihood of woodlot establishment. Here, we recommend that current and future forest land restoration initiatives focus on reducing the gender gap and increase women's participation in decision making, provide market information platforms on wood products, and include woodlot farmers in social organization. Current PLRs on tree tenure should be improved and clearly communicated by using the existing communication assets and social gatherings as channels of change and influence for decision-making. © 2019 by the authors.},

Farmers need to understand how to manage pests when production is in close proximity to people, especially since they have adopted intensive agricultural practices where more synthetic chemicals are used to control pests. Other issues including climate change, rapid urbanization, limited access to resources–land, training, and technology influence pest management strategies. A mixed method was used to collect data which examined how farmer interactions with other actors and technologies have influenced management of pest infestations and profits. All farmers in Tamale intensively cultivate cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) and we noted differences in profitability between farmers with, and without, formal training. There was a positive association between long-term farm experience and good pest management practices. Farmers with {\textgreater}10 years experience growing cabbage were more mindful of pre-harvest intervals in respect to pesticide application compared to those with less-farming experience. Farmer-to-farmer transfer was the most efficient way of disseminating agricultural information and creates an opportunity for sharing information on integrated pest management. There is a need for the creation of formal farmer–farmer training and education by government extension officers, building on informal opportunities provided by farmer-to-farmer knowledge transfer on safe handling, storage, and application of pesticides in peri-urban and urban farms. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using cellphone technology as a training tool on smallholder dairy farms (SDFs) in Kenya. This field trial was carried out between June and September 2017 on 40 farms randomly selected from members of the Naari Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society in Naari sub-location of Meru County, Kenya. An abridged dairy management handbook, developed by Farmers Helping Farmers and the University of Prince Edward Island, was translated into the local dialect, and disseminated as short message text. After pre-intervention knowledge and attitudes assessments on dairy management, farms were randomly allocated into intervention and comparison groups. Using an online short message service interface (because the study population all had cell phones but only 1.7\% had smart phones), short messages on management practices were sent daily, for 3 months, to the phones owned by the farmers in the intervention group. Post-intervention assessment of dairy management knowledge and attitudes related to the messages was done 3 weeks post-intervention. Within and between group comparisons and net changes were determined using t-tests, Chi-squared tests where applicable. There were no significant demographic or knowledge differences between the two groups pre-intervention. Compared to pre-intervention, trained farmers in the intervention group were significantly more informed on: mastitis prevention, disease (calf diarrhea) prevention, stall management, the role of a balanced nutritious diet on immunity and the resolution of some health conditions post-intervention. Translation of message content to the local language and using easily understandable terminology were reported to be helpful for better understanding and motivation of farmers to implement recommendations. Cellphone technology with a short message service interface can be an effective training tool for SDFs in remote areas of Kenya located far from where seminars are conducted for dairy farmers. © 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

Historically, print media as well as radio and television have served as major delivery channels. With the advent of cellphones, SMS (texting), and the Internet, these digital technologies now afford enhanced opportunities for reaching this poorly literate, low-resource client group quickly and efficiently. Here, we describe a two-step, rapid response approach to the Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), an invasive noctuid pest newly causing havoc on maize production in Africa and Asia. First, we developed a science-based, animated video – now being localized further into various languages across Africa and Asia – intended to aid semi-literate, smallholder farmers in identifying and scouting for fall armyworm effectively. Second, we made the animation easily available for (re)distribution in affected areas via the Internet and copying/sharing with Bluetooth®, thereby exponentially increasing the animation’s reach across a wide spectrum of diverse languages and literacy levels. In this way, this form of asymmetrical communication hybridizes and combines the educational qualities of print dissemination with the range of radio/television delivery. © 2018, Research Information Ltd.

	abstract = {Animal pollination is responsible for the majority of the human food supply. Understanding pollination dynamics in agricultural systems is thus essential to help maintain this ecosystem service in the face of human disturbances. Surprisingly, our understanding of plant–pollinator interactions in widely distributed smallholder agricultural systems is still limited. Knowledge of pollination dynamics in these agricultural systems is necessary to fully assess how human disturbances may affect pollination services worldwide. In this study, we describe the structure of a plant–floral visitor network in a smallholder Cucurbitaceae agricultural system. We further identify the main floral visitors of these crops and tested their importance by simulating how their extinction affected network structure and robustness. The observed network was highly connected and generalized but it was neither nested nor compartmentalized. Our results suggest that the structure of agricultural plant–pollinator networks could be inherently different from those in natural communities. These differences in network structure may reflect differences in spatial distribution of floral resources between agricultural and natural systems. We identified Augochlora nigrocyanea and Peponapis limitaris as the two most frequent floral visitors. However, removal of these species did not affect network structure or its robustness, suggesting high levels of interaction rewiring. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to describe the structure of a plant–floral visitor network in diverse agricultural systems in the tropics. We emphasize the need for more studies that evaluate network structure in agricultural systems if we want to fully elucidate the impact of human disturbances on this key ecosystem service. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {The dual pressures of climate change and population growth in Africa make enhancing sustainable development an important focus of initiatives hoping to reach as many people as possible with appropriate innovations. Resource and infrastructure challenges often limit the ability of programs to expand through the use of extension and other forms of in-person training. Although media such as radio, television, and mobile phones cannot replace the value of interpersonal communication, they can offer a low-cost alternative for reaching large audiences in even some of the most remote regions. With the increasing use of media for sustainable development come questions relating to the ability of these channels to move beyond a one-way flow of information to include and respond to local knowledge and experiences and to create dialogue, both farmer to farmer and between farmers and designers of educational messaging. This article evaluates the role of media in promoting sustainable agriculture in Zambia. Specifically, the findings present qualitative feedback from 34 smallholder farmers targeted by Community Markets for Conservation’s current radio programming efforts around sustainable agriculture. Results demonstrate the centrality of the radio program alongside other forms of communication, such as extension and farmer-to-farmer communication, as well as written and visual communication. These findings consider direct and indirect exposure to these efforts and the importance of radio in offering a foundation for dialogue and increased social diffusion of sustainable innovations in remote regions.

	abstract = {Most smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face food and nutrition security challenges arising from small land size, unavailability of, and poor access to quality seed, inter alia. A survey was conducted in the Zaka district of Masvingo province in Zimbabwe, to investigate the factors that limit smallholder farmers' ability to produce, store or sell certified seed. The factors considered were the availability of certified seed, the appropriateness of storage facilities for seed storage at household level and stored seed pest management. A standard structured questionnaire was administered, between January and May 2013 to 301 farming households. The results showed that the majority of the farmers (66 \%) could not procure locally all the seed they required. The only crop which farmers were assured of local availability as certified seed was maize. Farmers reported that the main reasons for the lack of seed for the other crops were: shortage of foundation seed (39.5 \%), lack of knowledge on seed production (34.8 \%), seed storage problems (16.2 \%) and small land size (8.6 \%). The majority of the farmers had their stored seed affected by pests with insects accounting for 82.7 \% of the damage and loss. The storage facilities used by farmers were not appropriate for effective pest control. Farmers used bedrooms (57 \%), granaries (19 \%), metal drums (11.5 \%), kitchens (10.4 \%) and other places (2.5\%) to store seed. Some of the facilities such as bedrooms create pest management challenges. The significant correlation between some seed storage factors indicate these factors should be monitored concurrently when dealing with smallholder farmers as they affect each other. Any seed intervention aimed at increasing availability of quality seed to farmers needs a holistic lens which considers the whole seed value chain from production, storage, pest management up to marketing, for it to have any meaningful impact. Not all other crop seeds were available, with sugar bean seed having the highest shortage. There is potential for business development if the seed crops in short supply are produced locally, especially after further verification of effective demand. Research institutions should explore mechanisms of increasing the uptake of their newer varieties by smallholder farmers through increased early interactions with the farmers. Smallholder farmers can be contracted by seed-houses to produce certified seed or to establish community seed enterprises that supply certified seed in their local communities. This would require adequate capacity building and availing desired foundation seed. © by the authors.},

	abstract = {With 77\% of the population living in rural areas, the development of agriculture is critical in reducing poverty in Cambodia. The growing demand for better quality vegetables offers farming families good opportunities to increase incomes and reduce their dependency on rice. Despite considerable progress in recent years, business opportunities are being lost as a result of a predominantly supply-driven approach and the slow rate of technology adoption within the sector. To strengthen the competitiveness of the Cambodian vegetable industry and to deliver elements of economic and environmental sustainability, there is an urgent need for the sector to embrace a market-driven approach. Strengthening trust and the dialogue between supply chain actors facilitates the coordination needed to act upon market signals. Using examples from a cooperation project between GIZ and East West Seed, this paper discusses the need for improved access to information and appropriate technology, and the significance this has in reducing risk and improving the incomes of smallholder farmers. The provision of embedded services and the pull of market forces are recommended as practical alternatives to the subsidies and market interference which presently plagues the sector. Fostering private sector initiatives which drive productivity, improve quality and increase the incomes of rural communities are presented as a viable and sustainable way for government and development agencies to complement traditional approaches to extension.},

Therefore, we conducted a cross section survey based on an accessibility sampling that consisted of 32 companies and 950 employees. This particular productive sector and region were chosen because they illustrate paradigmatic situations of changes in traditional production practices and work organization and also because rural workers' learning processes have been little explored in studies in the administration field. Individual learning was identified - difference between the current work experience and the previous experience - associated to the use of a few informal mechanisms instead of structured learning mechanisms. The results obtained did not validate the first hypothesis that the acquisition of work related knowledge is associated to variety, intensity, and interaction of learning mechanisms. On the other hand, the second hypothesis - that the internal and external learning mechanisms are associated to the amount of knowledge - was validated. The gap between the reviewed studies' results and those reported in this present study is related to the differences in companies' characteristics, market structures, products, and work organization.},

The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.},

	abstract = {This discussion paper attempts to present some of the future conditions for livestock production in developing countries and the options Donors as Danida has for supporting different strategies for development within this sector. The global food market is undergoing major changes, especially in the developing world. Driven by an increasing level of income of a large number of city dwellers, the per capita consumption of food of animal origin has increased dramatically, especially in Asia. The International Food Policy Research Institute estimated that the global demand will double by 2020. This paper is based on recent literature, and discuss possible consequences and challenges. One scenario is that the demand will be met by large scale industrialised units, another that small-scale producers will develop livestock production that can satisfy the demand and the markets. It is found that whereas technologies are readily available for industrialised production, development of a competitive smallholder-based livestock production, requires holistic and carefully focused interventions. It is concluded, that a market-driven development in many countries can be the stepping stone required for small-scale farmers to enter into a cash economy. It is also concluded that a laissez faire livestock policy will lead to a skewed development that by-passes and neglects the commercial potential of the small holder sector and an opportunity for fighting rural poverty is missed. Main findings are: Industrialised large-scale livestock production is expanding due to economies of scale, vertical integration and high demand for the products. The industrialised production is often favoured by more or less hidden subsidies, but it entails environmental hazards and risk of enzootic diseases, it changes consumer preferences and tend to marginalize small-scale producers and have a negative impact on economic growth and employment in rural areas. Therefore the governments, with the assistance of the donors, should consider to: • Support interventions to promote development of modern smallholder livestock production systems, which satisfy consumer's requirements for quantity and quality. • Establish enabling agricultural policies, infrastructure and vertical integration, that will promote private investment and interventions in the livestock sector. • Promote and support research and advisory services with focus on particular problems and technologies related to smallholder production systems. • Impose rules and regulations related to environmental impact of industrialized livestock production after the "polluter pays" principle. • Support environmental protection and assist in solving problems with collection and utilization of effluents from industrial livestock production. • Develop veterinary rules and regulations required for protection of public health. • Empower producer organisations to enable farmers to influence agricultural policies and to play a much needed active role in the dialogue with government for development of appropriate policies and strategies for the smallholder sector. Furthermore, smallholders as individuals have difficulties in profiting from the urban market, they have to organize to become an important player in the livestock industry. Donors like Danida, with policies for agriculture and livestock as well as objectives of support to poverty alleviation, are in principle in line with the findings, but it is perhaps less clear in actual initiatives, as stipulated in the present guidelines where the government is the central partner for the Danish assistance. In the future, it is important to focus more on the participation of the farming community and to facilitate agro-industrial development through market studies; business plans; education for the agro industry and feasibility studies for the livestock industry.},

	abstract = {In the Eduardo Mondlane irrigation scheme in Chokwe, southern Mozambique, land had been allocated in 1983 to approximately 12 000 farmers for growing rice (85\%) and maize (15\%). From the onset, maize production in the warm season was severely constrained by a number of pathogens and pests. During 1984-1988 a study on downy mildew, maize streak virus, stemborers and rodents, was carried out. This resulted in the formulation of a package of recommendations along lines of integrated pest and disease management, which was subsequently disseminated to farmers by the extension service. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of technology transfer, farmers were interviewed just before the new recommendations were disseminated (1988) and again two years after the start of the training and extension programme. Severe constraints in technology transfer to farmers were encountered due to the poor functioning of the extension service. It is concluded that improvements in communication and feedback mechanisms between farmers, extensionists and researchers and substitution of the prevailing 'top-down' training and extension methods by a 'bottom-up' approach are needed. In addition, rehabilitation and proper maintenance of the irrigation system and better land allocation to smallholders is required before research recommendations can be expected to work. ©1997ICIPE.},

	abstract = {Climate change such as extreme weather, unexpected temperature and rainfall fluctuations cause several significant risks to the agro-economy. This study, therefore, assessed the determinants of climate change perception (CCP), the level of perception and its impact on net farm income of rice farmers. This is imperative as the actual CC communication and policy, therefore, require a good understanding of smallholders' views and acknowledgment of individual's perception about CC. Employing cross-sectional data from 360 rice farmers selected from three States in South-West, Nigeria, a Ricardian model was used to analyse climate change impact on rice production. While accounting for selection bias, the study employed a double-hurdle (DH) model to estimate the determinants of farmers' perception of climate change. The results of DH estimation model show that location, access to credit, educational level and household size of the farmers are statistically significant factors influencing climate change perception (CCP). The result from the second hurdle shows that the perceived intensity of climate change was influenced by farm size, farming experience, marital status and educational level of smallholder rice farmers. The Ricardian model's result shows that farmers' income is influenced by CCP and their socio-economic characteristics. The results further indicate that smallholder rice farmers' net farm income is sensitive to marginal changes in both temperature and precipitation. Thus, this study recommends that government policies and investment strategies should be geared towards the support of education and the improvement of farmers' cooperatives, credit facilities and information about climate change, particularly in respect of smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The recommended improvements are imperative for food security. Investment in farmer training programmes is essential for development and may also be a panacea for improving the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies with the overall goal of increasing productivity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Kilombero Valley, one of East Africa’s largest seasonal wetlands, is a high-potential agricultural development corridor area in Tanzania. This seasonally flooded wetland is mainly used by smallholder farmers who cultivate during the rainy season, although there are some community-based irrigation systems that reduce hydro-climatic risks. In this study, we aim to understand how farmers’ aspirations and visions about the future are related to the current agricultural practices and human–water interaction. We specifically investigate the differences between farmers from rainfed and irrigated agriculture by using focus group discussions. Analysis of the in-depth interviews highlights how farmers’ actions both shape and respond to this highly dynamic and uncertain environment. Furthermore, we identify a close link, driven by the farmers’ level of agency, between aspirations and expected agro-economic development. The heterogeneity of farmers’ agency and hence their ability to cope with change is not only based on the socioeconomic status but also on their perception of the physical environment. We thus recommend that attention is also paid to the capacity for coping with environmental challenges that influences the level of farmers’ aspiration. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Mountain social-ecological systems (MtSES) are transforming rapidly due to changes in multiple environmental and socioeconomic drivers. However, the complexity and diversity of MtSES present challenges for local communities, researchers and decision makers seeking to anticipate change and promote action towards sustainable MtSES. Participatory scenario planning can reveal potential futures and their interacting dynamics, while archetype analysis aggregates insights from site-based scenarios. We combined a systematic review of the global MtSES participatory scenarios literature and archetype analysis to identify emergent MtSES archetypal configurations. An initial sample of 1983 rendered 42 articles that contained 142 scenarios within which were 852 ‘futures states’. From these future states within the scenarios, we identified 59 desirable and undesirable futures that were common across studies. These ‘common futures’ were grouped into four clusters that correlated significantly with three social-ecological factors (GDP per capita, income inequality, and mean annual temperature). Using these clusters and their associated significant factors, we derived four MtSES scenario archetypal configurations characterized by similar key adaptation strategies, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. We called these archetypes: (1) “revitalization through effective institutions and tourism”; (2) “local innovations in smallholder farming and forestry”; (3) “upland depopulation and increased risk of hazards”; and (4) “regulated economic and ecological prosperity”. Results indicate risks to be mitigated, including biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, cultural heritage change, loss of connection to the land, weak leadership, market collapse, upland depopulation, increased landslides, avalanches, mudflows and rock falls, as well as climate variability and change. Transformative opportunities lie in adaptive biodiversity conservation, income diversification, adaptation to market fluxes, improving transport and irrigation infrastructure, high quality tourism and preserving traditional knowledge. Despite the uncertainties arising from global environmental changes, these archetypes support better targeting of evidence-informed actions across scales and sectors in MtSES. © 2021},

	abstract = {Background: Agroforestry, the intentional integration of trees or other woody perennials with crops or livestock in production systems, is being widely promoted as a conservation and development tool to help meet the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Donors, governments, and nongovernmental organizations have invested significant time and resources into developing and promoting agroforestry policies and programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) worldwide. While a large body of literature on the impacts of agroforestry practices in LMICs is available, the social-ecological impacts of agroforestry interventions is less well-studied. This knowledge gap on the effectiveness of agroforestry interventions constrains possibilities for evidence-based policy and investment decisions to advance sustainable development objectives. Objectives: The primary objective of this Campbell systematic review was to synthesize the available evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions in LMICs on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. The secondary objectives were to identify key pathways through which agroforestry interventions lead to various outcomes and how the interventions affect different sub-groups of the population. Search Methods: This review is based on a previously created evidence and gap map (EGM) of studies evaluating the impacts of agroforestry practices and interventions on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. We included published and unpublished literature in the English language covering the period between 2000 and October 20, 2017. We searched six academic databases and 19 organization websites to identify potentially relevant studies. The search was conducted for our EGM in mid-2017, and we did not conduct an additional search for this systematic review. Selection Criteria: We included randomized control trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies assessing the effect of an agroforestry intervention on at least one outcome measure of agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, or human well-being for farmers and their farmland in LMICs. Agroforestry interventions include any program or policy designed to promote and support the adoption or maintenance of agroforestry practices, which include trees on farms, silvopasture, shade-grown crops, and homegardens with trees, among others. Moreover, the studies needed to include a nonagroforestry comparator, such as conventional agriculture or forestry systems or a before-after comparison. Data Collection and Analysis: We used a standardized data extraction spreadsheet to extract details about each included study. We also used a standardized form to assess risk of bias for each of the included studies in this SR. Meta-analysis techniques were used to combine and synthesize effect size estimates for the outcomes measures that had sufficient data. We used a random effects models for the meta-analyses and use Hedge's g (difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation) to report effect size estimates. The outcomes without enough evidence for meta-analysis were discussed narratively. Main Results: We identified 11 studies across nine countries, all of which used quasi-experimental methods. Overall, the quality of the evidence base was assessed as being low. Studies were rated as having high or critical risk of bias if they failed to convincingly address more than one of the main potential sources of bias, namely selection bias, group equivalence, and spillover effects. Given the low number of studies and the high risk of bias of the evidence base, the results of this SR are limited and should be considered a baseline for future work. The results of the meta-analysis for impacts on yields indicated that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a large, positive impact on yield (Hedge's g = 1.16 [−0.35, 2.67] (p =.13)), though there was high heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 98.99\%, (Formula presented.) = 2.94, Q(df = 4) = 370.7). There were positive yield impacts for soil fertility replenishment practices, including incorporating trees in agricultural fields and improved fallow practices in fields where there are severe soil fertility issues. In other cases, incorporating trees into the production system reduced productivity and took land out of production for conservation benefits. These systems generally used an incentive provision scheme to economically offset the reductions in yields. The result of the meta-analysis on income suggests that agroforestry interventions overall may lead to a small, positive impact on income (Hedge's g = 0.12 [−0.06, 0.30] (p =.20)), with moderately high heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 75.29\%, (Formula presented.) = 0.04, Q(df = 6) = 19.16). In cases where improvement yields were reported, there were generally attendant improvements in income. In the cases where payments were provided to offset the potential loss in yields, incomes also generally improved, though there were mixed results for the certification programs and the tenure security permitting scheme. One program, which study authors suggested may have been poorly targeted, had negative yield impacts. There was not enough comparable evidence to quantitatively synthesize the impacts of agroforestry interventions on nutrition and food security outcomes, though the results indicted positive or neutral impacts on dietary diversity and food intake were likely. Surprisingly, there was little evidence on the impacts of agroforestry interventions on environmental outcomes, and there was no consistency of environmental indicator variables used. However, what has been studied indicates that the environmental benefits are being achieved to at least some extent, consistent with the broader literature on agroforestry practices. The evidence base was insufficient to evaluate the interaction between environmental and social impacts. Several studies explicitly considered variable impacts across different population sub-groups, including differential impacts on small-holders versus large-holders, on woman-headed households versus male-headed households, and on richer groups versus poorer groups. Small-holder farmers typically experienced the most positive effect sizes due to the agroforestry interventions. Women and poorer groups had mixed outcomes relative to men and richer households, highlighting the importance of considering these groups in intervention design. Authors' Conclusions: There is limited evidence of the impacts of agroforestry interventions, restricting our ability to draw conclusions on the effect sizes of different intervention types. The existing evidence forms a baseline for future research and highlights the importance of considering equity and socio-economic factors in determining suitable intervention design. Some key implications for practice and policy include investing in programs that include pilot programs, funding for project evaluation, and that address key equity issues, such as targeting to smallholders, women, poor, and marginalized groups. Funding should also be given to implementing RCTs and more rigorous quasi-experimental impact evaluations of agroforestry interventions over longer time-periods to collect robust evidence of the effectiveness of various schemes promoting agroforestry practices. © 2021 The Authors.

Three projects addressing different challenges within livestock production are used to illustrate the use of and challenges with using a ToC framework.

Most existing literature on the impact of mobile phones in farming has examined the various components of the farming cycle in isolation, and failed to holistically account for the complex interactions and relationships between these components. In this study, we combine the strengths of the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) and Systems Theory (ST) as a theoretical lens to understand the impact of mobile phone use in farming and its developmental contributions on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in post-insurgency northeast Nigeria. On the basis of empirical data and literature, we develop a qualitative system dynamics model depicting mobile phone use in farming. The main feedback loops show that the greatest bane to farming in the area is insecurity and climate variability. However, better access to information and communications afforded by mobile phones empowers farmers and enables them to overcome these vulnerabilities. The use of feedback loops in analysis provides rigour and depth to the findings due to their ability to demonstrate the interdependencies between system components. We contribute to knowledge and inform practice by extending the understanding of the impact of mobile phone use in farming through system dynmics modelling. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity-based agriculture is the main form of agriculture practiced by smallholder farmers, who produce half the world’s food, especially in the Global South. This form of agriculture relies on planned biodiversity intentionally managed by farmers and on the associated biodiversity that spontaneously colonizes the agroecosystem. In recent decades, there have been increasing calls from researchers and society to support biodiversity-based agriculture as an alternative paradigm to today’s industrial agriculture. Building adapted governance and management systems for enhancing farmers’ access to agrobiodiversity is a key challenge for the development of biodiversity-based agriculture. To achieve this, a better understanding of how farmer’s access agrobiodiversity is needed, and in particular, how this access is affected by interactions between farmers and with institutions, i.e., social networks. In this article, we first review the literature on the role of social networks in farmers’ access to agrobiodiversity, in the form of crop diversity and associated biodiversity, and the related knowledge to manage this diversity. This review points at a major knowledge gap concerning how the composition and structure of these networks affect farmers’ access to agrobiodiversity. Then, we review literature on social-ecological networks to identify how this framework developed for environmental management could contribute in getting a better understanding of the role of social networks’ structure and composition in farmers’ access to agrobiodiversity. Based on this review, we propose a social-ecological network framework dedicated to crop diversity. Finally, we present potential applications of this framework to develop new participatory approaches for agrobiodiversity management and governance, adapted to biodiversity-based agriculture. © 2021, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers face many constraints to achieving food security. Optimal soil management is often limited by a lack of accessible and accurate soil characterization, and an associated lack of soil-specific management practice recommendations. Crop yields depend on both soil quality and soil-mediated fertilizer responses. Existing research on soil-fertilizer interactions is primarily based on farm trials and/or survey data, which are resource intensive and typically restricted to local scales. High-resolution (∼10-meter) remote sensing data and digital soil maps provide a low cost, scalable alternative. Here, we deploy methods based on the Sentinel satellite constellation to estimate soil and fertilizer impacts on irrigated wheat grain yields in Nepal and to inform precision soil and nutrient management recommendations. We first combine field data with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery to delineate wheat cropping areas for 2016–2019 with 92 \% accuracy. We then estimate wheat yields at 10-meter resolution using Sentinel-2 and weather covariates based on yield models parameterized from two different methods: 1) APSIM crop model simulations and 2) ground cropcuts from 147 fields. Using a large dataset of soil samples collected by the Nepal Agricultural Research Council, we examine the linear and non-linear effects of soil properties on wheat yields. Finally, the soil maps were combined with a survey of field-level crop management data and our yield estimates to test the interaction of soil quality with fertilizer effectiveness. Our ground-calibrated satellite model predicted yields with good accuracy (R2 = 0.55), while the uncalibrated simulation-based approach had weaker but significant prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.24). We find statistically significant gains in yield of 0.9–2.4 \% are possible by increasing soil organic matter and zinc from highly deficient values to optimal values of 2.2 \% organic matter (OM) and 0.67 ppm zinc (Zn). Using digital soil maps of Nepal produced by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), we map croplands deficient in zinc (Zn \&lt; 0.66 ppm) and organic matter (OM \&lt; 2.2 \%) and find that 72 \% of croplands in the Nepal Terai are experiencing less than optimal levels of these nutrients. We examine the effectiveness of nitrogen and zinc fertilizers, applied in amounts ranging from 0 to 150 kg ha−1 and 0 to 15 kg ha−1 respectively, in different soil quality regimes as determined by a soil quality index informed by standard relationships between crop yields and soil properties. Yields were significantly more responsive to zinc fertilizer inputs in soils with a higher than average soil quality but responded similarly to nitrogen inputs across different soils. Effects of soil and fertilizers on the simulation-based yield estimate were generally similar but less significant than effects on ground-calibrated yields. Overall, nitrogen and zinc increased ground-calibrated yields by 0.8 and 10.4 kg ha−1 per kg of nutrient input, respectively. This research demonstrates the potential of satellite data, crop simulation, and machine learning to examine the influence of soils on yields and guide precision fertilizer use in smallholder regions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study applied the multi-group structural equation modeling technique to identify differences in farmer motivations to adopting agroforestry practices in the Mt. Elgon region of Uganda. Data were collected from interviews with 400 smallholder coffee farmers belonging to four categories which included: (1) those actively participating in an Australian-funded trees for food security (T4FS) project from phase 1 (2014); (2) farmers neighbouring those actively participating in the T4FS project; (3) farmers actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 2 (2017) and; (4) farmers living distant and unaware of the T4FS project. We used the theory of planned behaviour framework to assess the adoption behaviour of these farmer categories resulting from project interventions. About 40\% of the variation in farmer motivation to integrate trees in their coffee plantations was explained by the significant variables of ‘attitude’ and ‘perceived behavioural control’ among farmers actively participating in the T4FS project from phase 1. However, the neighbors of participating farmers and farmers who had never interacted with the project were only motivated by ‘attitude’ and ‘social norms’ respectively. Farmer motivation resulting from social pressure was strongest among farmers who had never interacted with the project, and in the absence of project interventions, rely on existing social structures to drive change in their community. Farmers’ perceived behavioural control to overcome tree planting barriers and their attitude to the economic benefits of shaded coffee were significantly different among the four farmer categories (p {\textless} 0.05). The findings indicate that psychological factors are key drivers to the farmers’ internal decision-making process in agroforestry technology adoption and can be context-specific. The adoption behaviour of smallholder farmers is mainly shaped by existing community social norms and beliefs that tend to promote knowledge exchange, as opposed to the conventional knowledge transfer extension approaches. Norms are therefore an inherent part of social systems and can create distinct farming practices, habits and standards within a social group. Researchers and extension agents can act upon these identified positive attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural controls to guarantee adoption and sustainability of agricultural technologies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

It recognises the contribution of ES supporting and resulting from smallholder livestock and poultry production, but also details the limiting factors or EDS, such as tick-borne disease, birds of prey or unpalatable rangeland, produced by the same system. Using a mixed-methods approach, including focus group discussions with various Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) activities, key informant interviews, household surveys and land-use change mapping on GIS, we consider the relative value and benefits from ES after the effects of EDS, as well as the management and strategies that households adopt to minimise EDS. The effects of ES and EDS were expressed in economic terms to provide a common framework to assess the magnitude of their contribution or effect. Although animal husbandry made measurable contributions to households, with an average gross value of between R2605-R9753 across villages, EDS undermined the meaningful production of livestock and poultry goods and services. The average EDS-induced economic loss in households was between R8289-R22,426 per annum. Despite active management, often at substantial cost to the household, EDS undermined the health of livestock which resulted in a loss of the animal or potential goods and services produced. We emphasise the need to recognise both the positive and negative contributions of ecosystems to identify the complex feedbacks between ES and EDS which interact to determine local ways of doing things. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in Nepal are vulnerable to climate change-related extreme weather events. Adaptation in the agriculture sector is needed to mitigate social, economic, and ecological impacts from increasing levels of hazard activity. To examine this issue, a household survey of 350 farmers in the Terai region of Nepal was carried out to assess farmers’ risk perceptions towards three common extreme weather events (floods, cold spells, and heat waves) and to explore their intended responses to cope with future impacts. The intended common adaptation strategies include changes in farm management, seeking off-farm employment, emergency management planning, purchasing crop insurance, and the raising of awareness. Threat appraisal is the strongest predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted in response to slow-onset hazards (heat waves and cold spells), while coping appraisal is the major predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted to mitigate flood risk, a rapid onset hazard. Crop insurance and off-farm employment are farmers’ most preferred flood adaptation strategies, while crop insurance is the most preferred adaptation strategy for heat waves and cold spells. Other variables such as the number of past implemented strategies, experience with extreme events, community organisation membership, and access to credit and extension services were also significantly associated with farmers’ choices for adaptation strategies in response to the three extreme events. This information can be used to tailor community-centred communication about potential threats from different extreme weather events and government technical and financial support, which will be crucial for farmers to adapt effectively to climate change-related weather extremes. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

However, few empirical studies have investigated how smallholders perceive TPV in Vietnam. This study investigates smallholders’ attitudes towards TPV and their adapting practices in South Central Vietnam. A random sampling strategy was used to select 250 cereal smallholders for interviews and a structured questionnaire was developed to collect data. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were used. The study results show that smallholders had experienced TPV. They perceived that TPV have increased farming losses, labour costs in cereal fields, the costs of pest/weed control, the costs of water management, and the application rate of chemical inputs. The smallholders were adopting traditional adapting methods to reduce unexpected impacts of TPV on their cereal-based farming systems. Key adapting methods identified include: (1) dredging and restoration of irrigation canals; (2) planting of drought resistant cereal varieties; (3) usage of wells and water pumps for irrigation; and (4) early planting.

The study characterized climate hazards related to crop and livestock production in marginal areas of Zimbabwe based on field observations. The study was carried out using a participatory and interactive survey approach. The climatic related risks impinging on livestock and cereal production in communal areas were outlined. A tailored seasonal climate forecast system, based on farmers’ contextual knowledge and conventional approaches, for smallholder farmers aimed at providing information relevant for the management of climate-related production risks was developed. Thus, local knowledge which made farming possible in the past, through pre-season and intra-season farm management strategies under harsh climatic conditions needs to be appreciated and fused into new climate systems. The study recommends that Agricultural Extension Workers should communicate agro-meteorological information that is usable by conservation farmers to manage their food production from an informed position. Local Agricultural Extension Workers should identify and provide key local coping strategies where the tailored forecast could be useful to the farmers since they are strategically positioned in relation to the farmers’ environment. © 2020 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.},

	abstract = {Recent years have marked the emergence of the innovation systems approach as a shift from the conventional linear models of technology transfer. Linear technology diffusion models hinder participatory approaches of local actors such as smallholder farmers and regards them as spectators in the development process, which impedes wide adoption of technology by the intended beneficiary. This article sought to understand the potential of the innovations systems approach as an incentive to enhance the adoption of climate services by smallholder farmers through regarding them and other relevant stakeholders as part of the process, fostering knowledge sharing and interactive learning. The methodology included stakeholder/actor identification, mapping of stakeholder linkages, capacity building and active involvement of stakeholders through the climate services process. The results showed that unlike the conventional linear knowledge delivery process, the innovation systems approach takes into consideration the complex processes that are highlighted by non-linear processes, feedback loops, and other complex interactions that occur among heterogeneous actors. As such in place of the linear knowledge delivery approach, a more systems approach is necessary to help mobilize science and technology such as climate services to deliver benefits, which has the potential to enhance access, salience, credibility and legitimacy of the scientific information. © 2020},

Hence, African swine fever (ASF) has been playing a deeply depressing role on swine value chain of Benin since its first occurrence in the country in 1997. Exchanges between actors are fundamental among stakeholders for the overall performance of a value chain and is key in the way these can respond to challenges, as epizootic threats. The present study describes how stakeholders of the swine value chain interact in the diffusion of innovative practices facing an outbreak of ASF. In seven districts, focus groups were first organized with stakeholders to identify changes and other reactions that ensued from a recent ASF outbreak in Benin. In a second step, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted, following a respondent-driven sampling, to collect the contact information needed for social network analysis. The influence of actors’ characteristics on their degree centrality was tested through multiple linear regression model. Regulatory requirements and available incomes facilitated practice diffusion among groups of pork butchers, traders/brokers and input suppliers. Stockbreeders displayed passivity in the diffusion of practices whereas they should have the forefront role in addressing the challenge of ASF. Nevertheless, their significant interest in capacity reinforcement, associations, exchange visits and professionalization may lead them to increase their involvement in a joint control of the disease. © 2020},

	abstract = {Agriculture production in Nigerien rural areas mainly depends on weather variability. Weather forecasts produced by national or international bodies have very limited dissemination in rural areas and even if broadcast by local radio, they remain generic and limited to short-term information. According to several experiences in West Africa, weather and climate services (WCSs) have great potential to support farmers' decision making. The challenge is to reach local communities with tailored information about the future weather to support strategic and tactical crop management decisions. WCSs, inWest Africa, are mainly based on short-range weather forecasts and seasonal climate forecasts, while medium-range weather forecasts, even if potentially very useful for crop management, are rarely produced. This paper presents the results of a pilot initiative in Niger to reach farming communities with 10-day forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Global Forecast System (NOAA-GFS) produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). After the implementation of the download and treatment chain, the Niger National Meteorological Directorate can provide 10-day agrometeorological forecasts to the agricultural extension services in eight rural municipalities. Exploiting the users' evaluation of the forecasts, an analysis of usability and overall performance of the service is described. The results demonstrate that, even in rural and remote areas, agrometeorological forecasts are valued as powerful and useful information for decision-making processes. The service can be implemented at low cost with effiective technologies making it affiordable and sustainable even in developing countries. Nonetheless, the service's effiectiveness depends on several aspects mainly related to the way information is communicated to the public. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Large-scale land exploitation to jumpstart backward economies is often accompanied by massive environmental impacts. The broad concepts of productivity-oriented ‘bio-economy’ and conservation-oriented ‘eco-economy’ were proposed to transform exploitative land-based economies. Taking cases in Borneo as core examples, this paper explores 10 transformative strategies for sustainability: boosting upstream productivity of cash crops, activating under-utilised low carbon (ULC) land for production, upgrading and diversifying downstream activities, branding for more values (industrial), establishing new domestic demand for bio-resources, creating values for carbon and ecosystem services, enhancing agro-ecological resilience, establishing eco-based tertiary sectors, branding for more values (smallholders), and encouraging self-sufficient farming. Generally, utility-based development strategies with wealth creation as the centre of policymaking are inadequate to repair the previous environmental damage. Likewise, strategies that prioritise restoration have shown a limited contribution to economic growth as observed in the case of Borneo. The interconnected nature of economic productivity and conservation means that no single strategy is a perfect solution but a combination of them may produce a better outcome. While integrated landscape analysis that combines land-use models and economic analyses can facilitate understanding of the systems, in-depth area studies are necessary to capture the more subtle ‘human factors’ like socio-political dynamics. The existence of multiple stakeholders with different interests and values means that an ‘optimal’ combination would be a result of political negotiations rather than scientific investigations. To design and also effectively execute the strategies, communication, collaboration and co-production of knowledge between scientific communities and various stakeholders is imperative. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Agroecology increasingly gains importance in the discussion about sustainable food systems. To facilitate the transition from conventional farming to agroecological farming, adequate methods and concepts to measure and assess impact and productivity of agroecological farming systems (AFSs) are needed, which consider their multifunctionality and other specific characteristics, here called agroecological sustainability assessment frameworks and tools (ASAFTs). In the past years, many agricultural sustainability assessment tools and frameworks were developed but their suitability and applicability to AFSs was not investigated. To close this knowledge gap, we aimed at identifying, reviewing, and discussing published ASAFTs in the context of international cooperation, providing an overview of the current challenges, needs, and requirements in assessing AFSs at the farm level with the means of indicators. Desktop and scientific database research was conducted to identify and discuss published indicator-based ASAFTs at the farm level. The analysis was based on the following four framework elements that the authors considered to be essential for ASAFTs: (1) the adaptability to local conditions all over the world, (2) the involvement of farmers in the development process, (3) the consideration of the multiple functions of an agroecosystem in the definition and measurement of its productivity, and (4) the accounting for interactions between multiple agroecosystem functions and their measurement. Only a few analyzed assessment frameworks at least partly consider these essential elements and were designed specifically for AFSs. However, our study also showed that these frameworks were (1) restricted in their geographical application scope, (2) quite heterogeneous and barely comparable, and (3) based on productivity indicators that do not fully capture the multiple functions of AFSs. Therefore, we identified the need for the development of appropriate agroecological productivity indicators and common standard or reference frameworks for assessing AFSs, which will be crucial for upscaling agroecology. © 2020 by the author(s).},

Ordering effects are eliminated by warming up subjects in advance and using information disclosure. This paper uses the inferred attribute non-attendance method to process attributes ignored by the grain family farms and analyzes grain family farms’ preferences for different support policies with a mixed logit model and then uses a latent class model to analyze how the characteristics of grain family farms relate to different preference types. We find that grain family farms have a strong preference for agricultural subsidies, credit support, and technical support (the mean coefficient is greater than 0.8). Moreover, the preferences of grain family farms over the policy communication channel (the mean coefficient is greater than 0.5) cannot be ignored. Faced with the same policy attribute combination, grain family farms with high education levels, reasonable scales of operation, and good understanding of support policies are more likely to improve their profit margins. There are four preference types of grain family farms: finance preference (43.2\%), knowledge and technology preference (28.5\%), land transfer preference (15.4\%), and policy information preference (12.9\%). © 2020.

	abstract = {The ability of smallholder farmers to utilise seasonal climate forecast (SCF) information in farm planning to reflect anticipated climate is a precursor to improved farm management. However, the integration of SCF by smallholder farmers into farm planning has been poor, partly because of the lack of forecast skill, lack of communication and inability to see the relevance of the SCFs for specific farming decisions. The relevance of seasonal climate forecasting in farming decisions can be enhanced through improved understanding of SCF from the smallholder farmers' perspective. Studies that have been done of how smallholder farmers understand SCF and how the available SCFs influence smallholder farmers' decisions are limited. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to review how smallholder farmers make decisions on farming practices based on SCFs and the challenges and opportunities thereof. The review shows that the majority of smallholder farmers in Africa make use of either scientific or indigenous knowledge climate forecasts and, in some cases, a combination of both. There are mixed results in the area of evaluating benefits of SCFs in decision-making and farm production. In some cases, the outcomes are positive, whereas in others they are difficult to quantify. Thus, the integration of SCFs into smallholder farmers' decision-making is still a challenge. We recommend that significant work must be done to improve climate forecasts in terms of format, and spatial and temporal context in order for them to be more useful in influencing decision-making by smallholder farmers. Significance: • At the farm level, making the right decisions at the right time is rendered even more difficult in light of the increasing frequency of extreme weather patterns. • The threat of climate change makes accurate seasonal climate forecasting essential for African smallholder farmers. • Technological, social and interdisciplinary issues, communication and scale are some key challenges which impact the utility and uptake of SCFs in rural smallholder farms. • The integration of both scientific and indigenous knowledge forecasts is an opportunity for further exploration. © 2020.

	abstract = {Social farming helps mountain farms to deal with current socioeconomic challenges that threaten the cultural identity and traditions of mountain areas. It is an innovative bottom-up initiative that addresses societal needs and complements institutionalized social services. In the north Italian province of South Tyrol, social farming is mainly implemented by women farmers offering educational services on their farms. This paper examines how these activities influence the transmission and transformation of (agri)-cultural values of mountain farming in South Tyrol. Data were extracted from a 2017 online survey among farmers who offered educational services in this province. The results demonstrate that farms offering these services are distributed throughout the whole region. Through the variety of topics included in their lessons, farmers have a key role in transmitting (agri)-cultural values and traditions to nonfarmers. Although farm-based educational services in general may increase a farm's income, the results show that they contribute little to the economic viability of the farm. Nevertheless, these services provide an interesting field of action, where all family members can share ideas and interact with children, teachers, and parents. In parallel to cultural transmission, farm-based educational services can therefore transform traditional (agri)-cultural values in family farms, shifting from traditionally patriarchal values. Women farmers, in particular, gain an opportunity to acquire new skills and a personal income, independent of agricultural production. Therefore, the provision of these services contributes to the social sustainability of family farms. © 2019 Gramm et al.},

	abstract = {Information sharing is an important pillar for any strategy that aims to control infectious diseases especially in farms and systems that are connected. A study was designed to analyze practices related to sharing of animal health information and identify health constraints affecting livestock keeping in smallholder farming systems of Mwala in Machakos County. Data were collected through focus group discussions (number of groups = 3) and one-on-one questionnaire interviews (n = 172). These were analyzed using both descriptive and thematic approaches. The most (33\%; n = 158) feared animal disease was pneumonia which was also the most (62\%) frequently reported health problem. Rabies, Newcastle disease, and east coast fever were ranked high by the farmer groups. Current animal management practices, for example, failure to confine dogs, predispose the community to a number of health risks including bites from rabid animals. Smallholder farmers in Mwala utilize a number of options to communicate animal health problems; such sharing is, however, constrained by a number of factors including bad roads, poor coverage of mobile networks, and bad relationships between animal health providers and the farmers themselves. Some of the reasons why farmers delay the reporting of disease problems included the tendency for one to first try local herbal formulations, the bad times when cases are observed, and the unavailability of reliable animal health providers at the time when the farmers need them. This study has provided useful baseline data that can then be used to (1) design a village-based animal disease reporting system which is currently lacking in the surveyed villages and (2) support the county government’s efforts to manage animal diseases including zoonoses, through better reporting, for improved health, nutrition, and livelihoods. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

Data were gathered using a questionnaire and simple random sampling. Communication is integral to agricultural development, particularly so in the context of the FTLRP characterised by a dearth of information, education and training, ensued by the discriminatory command agriculture (Murisa and Chikweche, 2015). Farmers’ preferences of communication media in receiving agricultural innovations should be prioritised to improve agricultural communication and subsequently, productivity, which is dire in Zimbabwe in the light of the continuing food insecurity. The findings indicated that farmers prefer media that are stimulating and engaging such as television and demonstrations; convenient such as mobile phones and detailed such as books probably because the majority of them do not have training in agriculture. Demographic variables of age-group and education were found to be associated with communication preferences of some media. The study has implications for agricultural communication media policy. Beyond prioritisation of farmers’ preferences, a model of a multi-media approach to agricultural communication has been developed, that could widen communication reach if implemented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The location of properties holding livestock is fluid; edging towards the boundaries of urban Australia, increasing the likelihood that veterinarians will be exposed to livestock as part of the provision of routine veterinary services. This study was conducted to ascertain the challenges, knowledge level and training needs of veterinarians working within this landscape, with the ultimate aim of informing the development of resources and training to better equip them in this capacity. For this purpose, a cross-sectional study, using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among Australian veterinarians. The questionnaire comprised a mixture of 47 short closed, semi-closed and open-ended questions and was available for electronic distribution. Data was analysed descriptively and logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential factors associated with knowledge and practices of veterinarians in relation to smallholders. Complete responses were obtained from 91 veterinarians. The main livestock species kept by smallholder clients were sheep, goats, and cattle; with on-farm visits reported the most frequent interaction type, and responding to emergency situations the most frequently performed activity. The challenges experienced by veterinarians when working with smallholders were mostly related to external factors such as; lack of facilities, lack of client knowledge on animal health management and client's financial constraints. Over 95\% of respondents provided some level of biosecurity advice and zoonotic disease information as part of their routine veterinary service. Although veterinarians provide advice and support to smallholders, only 14.5\% considered themselves to be highly influential on smallholder practices. Confidence level in investigating disease differed by livestock species, with lower confidence reported in pigs, poultry and alpaca. Respondents were open to receiving assistance to support smallholders on matters related to disease, welfare or biosecurity, with other veterinarians (government and private), reported as the most frequently utilised resource. Having access to materials that could be distributed to smallholders was considered to be an effective way in which to provide information. While the risk of zoonotic disease was considered a challenge associated with working with smallholders, respondent's use of personal protective equipment (PPE), whilst performing common veterinary activities, was in many instances inadequate. Similarly, vaccination levels among veterinarians and other workers within the veterinary practice to prevent zoonotic diseases were variable. This study provides an insight into the way in which veterinarians engage with smallholders and highlight the importance of providing both groups with the tools necessary to manage the livestock to which are exposed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of the revolving fund (RF) regarding the ability of smallholder debtors to retrieve land title deeds, and also to examine the factors influencing the outstanding debts and percentage of outstanding interest of the smallholders in the Central and Northeastern regions of Thailand. Design/methodology/approach – Primary data were collected from 430 debtors in the Central and Northeastern regions of Thailand in order to compare the differences in livelihood assets as well as their opinions on benefits derived from the operation of the RF. Secondary data were also collected from the RF administration, in order to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the fund. Heteroskedasticity-corrected ordinary least squares and Tobit regression models were employed to examine the factors influencing the outstanding debts and percentage of outstanding interest of the smallholders, respectively. Furthermore, the student’s t-test was used to examine the differences in the livelihood assets among debtors in the two regions; and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine differences in livelihood indicator scores among the three types of debtors. Findings – The empirical results revealed that the RF is effective as the fund could provide loan to smallholders to enable them redeem their land title deeds from their previous creditors. The t-test results reveal significant differences in the livelihood assets among debtors in the two regions. One-way ANOVA indicates differences in livelihood indicator scores among the three types of debtors. The results of the heteroskedasticity-corrected ordinary least squares regression revealed that being married, low frequency of floods and less influence of third parties significantly reduced the outstanding debts. The results of the censored Tobit regression revealed that increased frequency of meeting with the RF administration, less influence of third parties, high land potential and interaction of age and experience significantly decreased the percentage of outstanding interest. Practical implications – It is imperative to intensify information and education regarding the regulations, payment terms and modalities to clients in order to facilitate repayments of the loans disbursed. The organization of the RF should pay particular attention to the role of the committees involved, information administration and loan repayment monitoring. The RF should increase the frequency of meetings with smallholders, minimize the influence of third parties and give priority to old and experienced smallholders who possess land with high potential for earning incomes to enable them repay the loans. Originality/value – To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that examined the effectiveness of the RF to enable smallholders retrieve their land title deeds. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of tomato diseases and local smallholder farmer knowledge was assessed in five villages in the Morogoro Region of Tanzania during the rainy and dry production seasons. The most commonly occurring foliar diseases in both seasons were early blight (88 of 100 fields), bacterial spot/speck (49), viral diseases (42) and Septoria leaf spot (34). Bacterial spot/speck, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, other viral diseases, and late blight were present in significantly higher numbers of fields during the rainy season than the dry season, while significantly more plants per field were affected by early blight in the rainy season than the dry season. A root health assay was conducted to assess root knot nematode damage and root rot severity, and root knot nematodes were found in 44 of 50 fields surveyed. Farmers used local names for plant diseases, which tended to be associated with the symptomatology of the disease, concepts borrowed from other aspects of life, perceived causal agent or weather conditions. Identification of local names improved communication between farmers and researchers and elucidated how farmers perceived key diseases in the region. Extension materials were developed to improve farmers’ identification and management of key tomato diseases in the region. Farmers can better allocate limited resources to manage key diseases through an improved understanding of prevalent diseases and local plant disease knowledge. This study serves as an example of how plant pathologists can develop a baseline understanding of key regional plant disease constraints through the integration of field surveys and ethnophytopathological studies. © 2018 The Canadian Phytopathological Society.},

	abstract = {Agriculture continues to be the thrust of Uganda's economy, directly employing majority of the population. However, there is deficiency in extension service delivery with few trained extension workers to support smallholder farmers. As a result, there have been strides to revolutionize traditional agriculture extension delivery through Village Enterprise Agent Model using mobile telephony digital extension platform. A cross sectional study design was adopted using ethnographic interviews and survey questionnaire with 70 VEAs. The diffusion of innovation theory and technology acceptance model are applied to examine the VEAs' experience in using mobile telephony as a tool to deliver agriculture extension services. Explicitly, the study investigated the capacity of VEAs to deliver extension services, how they do it, the kind of information delivered and the challenges to this model. Study findings revealed that social networks of farmer groups are key diffusion channels through which VEAs reach smallholder farmers. Adopters' characteristics such as VEAs' education background, community leadership skills and prior experience in using mobile telephony has a strong bearing on the ease of disseminating digital messages to farmers. In addition, the Kulima mobile telephony digital platform has supported real time dissemination of agricultural information. This is integrated with pragmatic demonstration gardens, farmer exchange visits, home visits to enhance farmers' peer learning. The sustainability of VEA model, with no clear incentive system, amidst complicated agriculture terminologies used in digital messages are some of the challenges to the model. Thus, future extension delivery using community agents and information communication technology should be cognizant of the social cultural dynamics, social nodes and ties of farmers and translate mobile digital messages into indigenous languages. © 2019 WIT Press},

	abstract = {Description of the subject. To boost the development of the national palm oil sector, one of the most promising moves for the Cameroonian government would be to improve partnerships between agro-industries and smallholders in order to increase the latter’s plantation yields and oil extraction rates. Objectives. Drawing on successful experiences in Southeast Asia, this paper examines the conditions for establishing a win-win partnership between agro-industrial companies and smallholders in the Cameroonian palm oil sector. Method. The study was carried out in three production basins in the Centre and the Southwest regions of Cameroon where such partnerships were initiated before the collapse of the National Aid Fund for Rural Development (FONADER) in the 1970s. In participatory workshops involving at least twelve stakeholders (palm oil producers, artisanal and industrial millers, intermediaries and agricultural extension services), the participants’ knowledge was integrated together through individual and collective reflection, with a guarantee of equal expression and consideration of views. Two workshops followed a strict adaptation of Participatory Prospective Analysis (PPA); a third followed a semi-directed participatory approach. Interactions between participants produced definitions of the systems studied and the variables involved, different plausible future scenarios, and recommendations for decision making. Results. Access to technical and managerial capacity building, terms of the contract, access to shareholding in the company by smallholders, and legalization of the terms of the contract emerged as the major items that would influence a sustainable partnership between agro-industries and smallholders. Conclusions. Participatory derived recommendations show that long-term partnerships between agro-industry and smallholders depend on a negotiated contract agreement between the partners to ensure transparency and trust. In addition, a dedicated smallholder department in charge of village plantations within agro-industrial companies can facilitate communication between partners. © 2018, FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

On this rationale, this study was carried out to explore the applicability of the concept of converging 'Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)' to promote sustainable knowledge sharing amongst the agricultural communities in Sri Lanka. A multi-stage community consultative process with a set of designated officials ("Sponsors") and a series of semi-structured questionnaire survey with a cross section of smallholder agriculture farmers (n=246), were carried out in the Batticaloa, Kurunegala and Puttalam districts to gather the baseline data. This was followed by a number of field experiments ("Campaigns") with the farmers (n=340) from same geographical areas. The two FOSS, namely: (1) "FrontlineSMS" for 'Text Messaging' and (2) "FreedomFone" for 'Interactive Voice Responses', were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge sharing within the farming communities. It was found that FOSS intervention increases the 'Text messaging' and 'Voice Call' usage in day-to-day agricultural communication by 26 and 8 percent, respectively. The demographic factors like age and educational level of the farmers have a positive influence on the knowledge sharing process. And also the 'Mobile Telephony' was the most extensive mode of communication within the communities. The outcome of analysis, as a whole, implies that, with a fitting mechanism in place, this approach can be promoted as a "drive for positive changes" in agriculture-based rural communities in developing countries like Sri Lanka, and those in South and East Asia with similar socioeconomic and cultural perspectives.},

Kenyan farmers are faced with limited public agricultural extension services, narrowing their sources of useful information including adaptive strategies that would help them cope with the impacts of climate change. Radio can be an efective extension tool with the ability to reach many farmers in their local language. This study investigated the potential of radio in influencing the utilization of climate change information by farmers in Kilifi County located along the Kenyan coast. Education and communication about climate change was undertaken using radio to make available and understandable information to different social and cultural groups. This study revealed that radio can effectively complement other agricultural extension methods and has the potential to engage farmers on climate change issues and motivate them to take action, if appropriate approaches are used. Although very few of the farmers surveyed (33\%) reported to have listened to the programs, a high percentage (82\%) of those who did implemented the recommended strategies and technologies they heard. The major challenges reported by farmers to accessing the radio programs were lack of a radio and unsuitable program timing. An additional reported challenge was the inability to store or record the programs resulting in farmers relying on their own recollection when implementing strategies. Further research should explore the use of social learning approaches that encourage group rather than individual listenership (such as community listening clubs and community-based radio schools) to overcome these challenges.},

Institutions of higher education, such as the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), are in unique positions to build intellectual capital, address educational needs along the DVC, and sustainably develop the capacity to address development challenges. A tri-lateral partnership with universities from Malawi (LUANAR), the United States (Michigan State University) and India (Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University) was formed, to utilize collective strengths and experiences, to build educational capacity at LUANAR and provide graduates with needed knowledge and skills to support the DVC in Malawi. The central aim of the project was to enhance higher education capacities at LUANAR for curriculum development, applied technical instruction, and agricultural community engagement in Malawi, using evidence-based strategies for economic development and enhancement of the dairy livestock value chain. Needs assessments of the DVC and its stakeholders were completed to identify needs, challenges and opportunities. Stakeholders (extension workers, farmers, processors, marketers/retailers) identified specific needs, skills, and services to support the DVC, and farmers identified specific constraints to dairy production and marketing. Strategies to improve LUANAR’s capacity to address DVC stakeholder needs were implemented. Institutional capacity building efforts, using a process-oriented framework emphasizing long-term sustained impact, focused on developing training and outreach focused on drivers of rural economic growth and poverty reduction, mainstreaming outreach into the local dairy sector, and promoting innovative outreach and teaching approaches. Communication between stakeholders and LUANAR improved, faculty received research and educational training, interdisciplinary teaching and research increased, and new curricula for DVC certificate programs were created. The learning experiences for LUANAR faculty and students resulted in significant scholarship pursuits, generation of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary DVC curriculum, field level-case studies and practical interventions to address stakeholder needs. The project enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, and provided faculty with valuable training and skills to support training the next generation of educators, researchers, and workers that will serve the DVC in the future. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV.

	abstract = {Food security and poverty remain aggravating challenges in East Africa despite decades of development work and research. Enhancing food security having complex dimensions of food availability, food accessibility, food stability and food utilisation, requires an integrated approach that transcends disciplinary boundaries and aims at solving real world problems not solely at contributing scientific knowledge. Horticulture, in particular, African Indigenous Vegetables (AIVs) provide a comparatively advantageous entry point as they offer largely untapped potentials in terms of workplaces and income opportunities, the delivery of vital micronutrients for combatting malnutrition and, not least, a raised diversity of agricultural production systems. However, top-down research approaches generating only knowledge from selected disciplines have reportedly failed to provide smallholder farmers with affordable, practical and readily available solutions to their problems; adoption rates of scientific inventions are low. Interdisciplinary knowledge generation must be embedded in an effective innovation system extending to all stakeholders to bring about change. This paper will present a research frameworka that holistically analyses the food system and AIV value chains of Kenya and bordering regions of Tanzania and Ethiopia using an integrative, inter- and disciplinary framework adapted from natural, social and communication science, ecology, gender studies and development economics, developed by more than one hundred young and senior researchers from Kenya and Germany within a major international research project. As case study, novel empirical results will be presented using the innovation system approach (one of fourteen elements of the research approach) focussing on the systemic determinants of all innovative processes and activities possibly taking place in the Kenyan AIVs sector. Through a focused analysis of factors affecting innovation in the case of AIVs' seed supply and the actors working together, the problem-focused innovation system provides a promising solution(s).},

The success of empowerment will improve the competitiveness and reduce the level of dependency of the communities and individuals towards the government and the country. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine the role of MPOB (Malaysian Palm Oil Board) as the agency responsible for the development of rural Bidayuh community empowerment and types of empowerment that have resulted in the Bidayuh rural community. This study uses the phenomenological research paradigm that focuses on understanding and narrations of the Bidayuh smallholders' rural community in the District of Serian, Sarawak on how their empowerment were resulted. The sample was selected using the non-probability sampling that is the purposive sampling and the snowball sampling. A total of 16 informants were selected in this study to be interviewed in-depth. The study found that the role of MPOB consists of information sharing on oil palm cultivation, technical assistance, advisory services and expertise, providing assistance with seeds, fertilizers and pesticides as well as marketing. The type of empowerment that has been built consists of the individual empowerment, technical, communication and marketing of the oil palm products. In conclusion, MPOB is only instrumental as an agent in the Bidayuh community empowerment in a structure, and this structure is controlled by the agency through a top-down approach. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

	abstract = {Smallholder irrigation schemes are largely supply driven such that they exclude the beneficiaries on the management decisions and the choice of the irrigation schemes that would best suit their local needs. It is against this background that the decentralisation framework and the Dublin Principles on Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) emphasise the need for a participatory approach to water management. The Zimbabwean government has gone a step further in decentralising the management of irrigation schemes, that is promoting farmer managed irrigation schemes so as to ensure effective management of scarce community based land and water resources. The study set to investigate the way in which the Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme is managed with specific emphasis on the role of the Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), the level of accountability and the powers devolved to the IMC. Merrey's 2008 critique of IWRM also informs this study which views irrigation as going beyond infrastructure by looking at how institutions and decision making processes play out at various levels including at the irrigation scheme level. The study was positioned on the hypothesis that 'decentralised or autonomous irrigation management enhances the sustainability and effectiveness of irrigation schemes'. To validate or falsify the stated hypothesis, data was gathered using desk research in the form of reviewing articles, documents from within the scheme and field research in the form of questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and field observation. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to analyse data quantitatively, whilst content analysis was utilised to analyse qualitative data whereby data was analysed thematically. Comparative analysis was carried out as Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme was compared with other smallholder irrigation scheme's experiences within Zimbabwe and the Sub Saharan African region at large. The findings were that whilst the scheme is a model of a decentralised entity whose importance lies at improving food security and employment creation within the community, it falls short in representing a downwardly accountable decentralised irrigation scheme. The scheme is faced with various challenges which include its operation which is below capacity utilisation, absence of specialised technical human personnel to address infrastructural breakdowns, uneven distribution of water pressure, incapacitated Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), absence of a locally legitimate constitution, compromised beneficiary participation and unclear lines of communication between various institutions involved in water management. Understanding decentralization is important since one of the key tenets of IWRM is stakeholder participation which the decentralization framework interrogates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper draws on working experiences with the transitions to market-oriented organic rice in Chiang Mai province, Northern Thailand. We outline how smallholder farmers make decisions towards organic rice and at the same time, incorporate rice biodiversity, and improve agronomic performance, entrepreneurial skills and competences through multi-level social interactions. We employed supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to document how smallholder farmers incorporate agro-biodiversity in their organic farming design. The study covered farmer groups in Chiang Mai Valley with varying experiences and scale of operation. It focused on farmers' perception on agro-biodiversity, its functionality, and decision to incorporate it into organic rice system, as well as the outcome. We observed several farmer innovations of utilizing agro-biodiversity to stabilize productivity and enhance farm income. Three genetically diverse rice varieties with different processing techniques were produced to increase value addition. Farmers tested rice varieties for site specific adaptation before embarked on large scale production. They also modified and adapted dry seeded rice technique to improve water management and reduce production cost. We studied the trading partnership between farmer groups and organic farmer-cum-trader through contract arrangement to see how social mechanism makes contract farming work for smallholder farmers. Despite several obstacles faced by farmers during the transition to organic rice, we conclude that incorporating rice biodiversity in organic system provides a starting point for farmers to value functionality of agro-biodiversity.},

	abstract = {By means of quantitative and qualitative research the doctoral dissertation has attained methodical insights into competences and usage levels of new technologies for marketing purposes in agri-businesses in the Republic of Croatia. The results and observations provided in the thesis indicate that swift action is required in order to improve the current situation and prepare farmers for forthcoming changes. In biotechnical sciences there is a need for continuous updating, research and control of interdependent processes and complex relations, which in turn creates a need for a unified system of knowledge dissemination. In order to manage a set of information arising from such processes, it is necessary to have a system that will allow us to store and transfer the acquired knowledge in a safe and simple way in real time, ensuring completeness of information. In today's world, the key role in this process is to be played by information and communication technologies (ICT) encompassing the use of computers and communication technologies, as well as technologies for information management and transfer. Together with other ICT, the Internet is a resource that can bridge the gap between professionals of different expertise on one hand and people living in rural areas and farmers on the other, as it provides a platform for interaction and dialogue. Furthermore, ICT can foster new cooperation and networking through inter-sectoral contacts between government institutions, different support agencies and farmers. The efforts to implement ICT in the agricultural sector are held back by a range of limiting factors, such as: the necessity to reconstruct the sector itself, required investments in new communication systems and adjunct platforms, low levels of computer literacy among farmers, insufficient infrastructure, etc. Taking all this into account, it is obvious that the Internet and modern technologies can be drivers of positive change in agriculture. The primary goal of the dissertation was to develop a theoretical program and process of marketing application in agricultural sector, followed by tactical and strategic options from the standpoint of a particular business entity operating in agriculture, which can occur by using ICT. The analysis has revealed that in Croatia even the theoretical approach to agri-business marketing is underdeveloped, which makes it difficult to implement marketing in daily operations, and to integrate ICT in a particular marketing program and marketing process. Given the specific characteristics of agricultural production, the traditional industrial marketing mix cannot be applied there in a straightforward way. It is more acceptable to observe agricultural activities as a combination of production and services and to take into account the additional "3P" elements (people, processes, physical evidence), which was duly considered in the dissertation. The primary research was conducted in order to determine whether, and to what extent, agri-business operators are prepared to adopt and apply ICT. The qualitative research was carried out by in-depth interviews, whereas CATI method was used for quantitative research. The research was carried out on a random sample of family farm businesses (N=572), with twophase stratification (by the county and village size). Only the farms that were subsidized in 2009 (according to the official document of the Paying Agency for Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development) were included in the survey. Judging by the family farm businesses included in our sample, there is a low level of ICT possession/ usage, as well as ICT competences among farmers. After investigating the cross-tabulation according to demographic indicators, it can be concluded that the average family farm business with the highest level of computer literacy is situated in the Zagreb County, was registered in the period between 2000 and 2005, has its own web-site, livestock farming is its primary activity, carried out on the land plot of 5-10 hectares. This is, of course, the average result intended to generate information on the profile of an ICT-competent family farm business, which does not exclude good examples outside this average profile. The hypothesis proposed in the dissertation was that the agricultural sector has a great potential, with ample room for improvement achievable through benefits brought about by information and communication technologies. This hypothesis was confirmed by the analysis of secondary data and the results of primary research. Substantiating the stated hypothesis can be highlighted as the original scientific contribution of the doctoral dissertation.},

One of the major reasons is their lack of knowledge of government policy on tree registration. To help improve the flow of information and understanding of tree registration policies among smallholder tree farmers and other stakeholders, a Primer on Tree Registration, Harvesting, Transport and Marketing Policies on Private Land was developed. Produced through the participation of stakeholders, including tree farmers, the DENR, and local government officers, police, and timber dealers, the Primer is highly visual and has been released in English as well as Waray-Waray and Cebuano dialects. This paper reports findings of focus group discussions conducted to gauge user reactions to the Primer. The Primer was considered as a valuable source of information about tree registration policies. Aside from being comprehensible, FGD participants found it attractive, perceived it to be intended for them and free from content that confused them. However, farmers suggested that illustrations need to be improved by making the persons portrayed more presentable and reflective of their actual tree farm operations. Participants said that aside from the Primer, the flow of information on tree registration policies could be improved through the use of multi-media including posters, radio broadcasts, and presentation in seminars for farmers. © 2009 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

Advisers of the official Extension Service, the publications of this service and farmers’ monthlies were considered to have contributed to farmers’ practical, agricultural knowledge more than the other communication channels. Among the activities of the Extensiom Service, personal farm visits by advisers were preferred. Next came other forms of indnvidual communication: farmers’ visits to the extension office and calls to the adviser’s horme. Group activities, like courses and group meetings in the village, were less frequented. The communication of agrotechnical information is much more common than advice on economic and organizational matters; yet the majority of farmers would like to receive more economic advice. Advisers had more contact with better educated farmers. All other demographic factors had no significant influence on the dependent variables. The Israeli findings were compared, where feasible, with studies made in the U.K., U.S A., Canada, Australia and Germany. When given the opportunity to mention peers and family as main source of information, this source came in first place in Australia, Canada and Germany. Israel was the only country reviewed, in which extension was the main source of information for farmers. In the U.K., in a U.S. and a Canadian study, the press took first rank.

The second part addresses the main constraint inhibiting the development of this role: the lack of appropriate farm management tools suitable for use by extension workers advising smallholder farmers. Management decisions are analysed in terms of a theory of human problem-solving in order to show that decision rules may provide a basis for developing formal management techniques more appropriate to smallholder agriculture. Smallholder farm systems in northern Malawi are described and their management modelled using sets of decision rules in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of these rules as management tools.

	abstract = {Background: Agriculture contributes significantly to the welfare of smallholder farmers, but it has become highly susceptible to climate change, due to its reliance on the increasingly erratic rainfall patterns. Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) offers important opportunities for enhancing food security and incomes through increased agriculture productivity. Technology evaluation through impact studies provides information on the effect of CSA on farmer welfare, thereby highlighting its potential in optimizing agriculture productivity. This paper analyses the impact of CSA adoption on food security and income of households, using cross-sectional survey data collected from 386 households across four districts in Zimbabwe. The analysis was done using the endogenous switching regression model which controls for selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity, a commonly used method in adoption impact analysis. Results: The study found several agricultural and socio-economic factors which affect adoption and food security. The econometric results show that the status of soil fertility in fields, distance to input and output markets, ownership of communication assets, and Total Livestock Units (TLU) have a significant impact on the decision of farmers to adopt CSA. The Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATT) and Average Treatment Effects on the Untreated (ATU) were found to be positive and significant for adopters and non-adopters, indicating that CSA adoption has had a significantly positive impact on the welfare of the farmers. An analysis of the outcomes revealed that the characteristics of farmers and farms, as well as market factors, significantly affect the welfare of households. The household income, with reference to the adoption of CSA, was significantly affected by factors such as the education of household head, labour size, TLU, and asset index. Food security was influenced by factors such as the education of household head, TLU, access to sanitation, and arable land size. Conclusions: The study concludes by giving policy recommendations centred on the access to inputs, sanitation, and encouraging investing in assets and TLU. The findings indicate that the adoption of CSA has a positive impact on the welfare of farmers. To exploit the full potential of these technologies, the study suggests that access to timely weather forecasts must be ensured, that sanitation must be promoted, and that incentives must be provided for agricultural input agro-dealers to decentralize to rural areas. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Farmers adopt a range of technical and non-technical adaptation behaviors (TANAB) to alleviate the negative effects of drought. Understanding this adaptation behavior and its determinants is essential for improving adaptation capacity and promoting sustainable agriculture. In this study, we investigated the factors affecting TANAB using the Health Belief Model (HBM) as a theoretical framework. A survey was conducted of 320 farmers in Dashtestan County, Bushehr Province, southern Iran, on the shores of Persian Gulf. We used multi-stage stratified random sampling to select the research samples and applied structural equation modeling to analyze the determinants of TANAB. The findings revealed that the self-efficacy variable is the most important predictor of TANAB. As well as self-efficacy, other determinants of technical adaptation behaviors (TAB) are perceived barriers, severity, and susceptibility. Self-efficacy and cue to action were found to determine non-technical adaptive behaviors (NAB). This study indicates the differences between the determinants of TAB and NAB and emphasizes the key role of self-efficacy. The results of this study have implications for policymakers in the agricultural sector and can help in the development of interventionist policies to improve rural development in response to environmental crises. Governments and policymakers need to reinforce capacity-building potential for agricultural extension systems and adaptation training through information and communication technologies. This investment in education is critical for sustainable agricultural development and encourages farmers to adopt appropriate drought strategies aiming reducing farmers’ vulnerability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, we use a cluster randomized controlled trial to examine whether improved extension services influence smallholder farmers’ decisions to try a newly introduced improved wheat variety in Ethiopia. The experiment involved demonstration trials and field days, and improved capacity of Development Agents in facilitation and communication skills. The empirical results revealed that farmers’ decisions to try the newly introduced wheat variety were highest in the villages where demonstration trials and field days, and improvements in the Development Agents’ facilitation and communication capacity were introduced simultaneously. We also found a positive effect of improved extension services on yields, and the use of chemical fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides, but only the use of herbicides and pesticides were statistically significant.

	abstract = {This article assesses the interactions between participation in Malawi's largest public works programme, the Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF), and three widely promoted climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices. Drawing on three waves of national panel household survey data, we find that participation in MASAF significantly increases the probability that farm households adopt the resource intensive CSA practices of building soil water conservation structures and applying organic fertilizers. Moreover, participation in MASAF contributes to a sustained adoption of these practices over multiple agricultural seasons. We empirically demonstrate that the standalone impact of the CSA practices on maize productivity and the value of crops harvested under normal and dry conditions is, in most cases, not significantly different from zero. However, we find a reduction in sensitivity to low precipitation when MASAF participation occurs in the previous agricultural season. Moreover, the joint treatment effect of MASAF participation with sustained adoption of soil water conservation structures substantially increases households’ productivity and welfare. This synergistic benefit is likely driven by the transfer of skills learned during MASAF public works to farmers’ own fields. Results suggest that the CSA agenda can be enhanced by explicitly integrating existing social protection interventions with the promotion of CSA practices. © 2021 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)},

This four-year study evaluates an ICT-enabled extension project in Senegal using radio and mobile phone services to encourage rural smallholder farmers’ use of certified improved seeds and organic and inorganic fertilizers across Senegal. Data were collected using large-scale annual surveys in six regions over four years as well as focus groups. The findings suggest that, in general, the forms and format of ICT-enabled extension services deployed failed to significantly contribute to the adoption of promoted technologies. Personal connections to participatory farm trials were consistently associated with adoption, and phone-based voice messaging appears to have potential to increase technology uptake. Gender-based disparities in engagement with ICT services and Senegal's poorly developed systems for producing and distributing quality seeds emerged as key factors limiting the effectiveness of this project.

We review here recent developments in the biology and management of rodent pests in cereal cropping systems in Asia. The past decade has seen a strong focus on ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM), its adoption in field studies significantly increased rice yields (6–15\%) and income ({\textgreater}15\%) in seven Asian countries. EBRM principles have also been successfully applied to maize in China. We provide case studies on EBRM in Cambodia, on interactions between rodent pests and weeds, and on the importance of modified wetlands for biodiversity and rodent pest management. Knowledge on post-harvest impacts of rodents is increasing. One research gap is the assessment of human health impacts from a reduction of rodent densities in and around houses. We identify 10 challenges for the next decade. For example, the need for population modelling, a valuable tool missing from our toolbox to manage rodent pests in cereal systems. We also need to understand better the interactive effects of cropping intensification, conservation agriculture and climate change. Finally, new management approaches such as fertility control are on the horizon and need to be considered in the context of smallholder cereal farming systems and mitigating health risks from zoonotic diseases associated with rodents. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Despite significant work to enhance women's empowerment in agriculture, women remain marginalized across the globe. This includes gender gaps in agricultural extension and advisory service implementation that can lead to inequitable resource and knowledge access by farmers, specifically women. However, gender does not exist in isolation, it is place and time specific. This study investigated the impact of gender and geography on smallholder farmer access to and agency over resources/knowledge. The overarching question we explored was the role that extension providers might play in building farmer adaptive capacity and gender equity. To do so, a mixed-methods approach was used to develop a new multidimensional index from participant responses to 352 surveys and 44 focus groups. The index has four domains that represent farmer's access to resources, leadership opportunities, household power, and time allocation; it is called the Local Agricultural Potential Index or L-API. The index was applied to a case study setting in rural Liberia due to its designation as a USAID-Feed the future country, and national investment in gender equality and poverty alleviation through agricultural development. Statistical and spatial analysis results indicate that women in Liberia, on average, have lower access to information and communication technology, leadership opportunities, and credit; as well, when compared to their male counter parts, less agency to make decisions at home and in the community. Further, a surprising spatial finding was that rurality did not have a diminishing impact on access. We concluded that the L-API is one example of a process and the resulting tool, informed by locally relevant indicators, to help improve farmer access to and agency over extension services. The L-API is meant to provide a baseline tool to be tailored in different locations based on local needs and can be used as a measure for adaptive capacity. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Understanding what mechanism behind this is critical for agricultural and environmental sustainability. By using a fixed effect panel model of over 20,000 rural households in China from 1995 to 2016, we found that the low ratio of fixed inputs such as machinery and knowledge to total inputs is the key factor leading to over-fertilization in smallholder farms. Low fixed input can result in or interact with nutrient-unbalanced fertilization, low agricultural income ratio and more cash crops that further aggravate fertilizer overuse. Smallholders lack fixed inputs, then compensate by over-applying fertilizer to attempt to achieve their yield goals. Thus, improving fixed input via increasing the average farm size to 3.8 ha or advanced service rental could save not only 45\% fertilizers but also increase 16\% agricultural net profit, benefiting agricultural and environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Effective livestock vaccination has the potential to raise prosperity and food security for the rural poor in low and middle income countries. To understand factors affecting access to vaccination services, and guide future policy, smallholder farmers in three locations in India were questioned about vaccination of their cattle and buffalo, with particular reference to foot and mouth disease (FMD), haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) and blackquarter (BQ). In the three regions 51\%, 50\%, and 31\% of respondents reported vaccinating their livestock; well below any threshold for effective population level disease control. However, within the third region, 65\% of respondents in villages immediately surrounding the Kaziranga National Park reported vaccinating their cattle. The majority of respondents in all three regions were aware of FMD and HS, awareness of BQ was high in the Kanha and Bandhavgarh regions, but much lower in the Kaziranga region. The majority of respondents had positive attitudes to vaccination; understood vaccination protected their animals from specific diseases; and wished to immunise their livestock. There was no significant association between the age or gender of respondent and the immunisation of their livestock. Common barriers to immunisation were: negative attitudes to vaccination; lack of awareness of date and time of vaccination events; and difficulty presenting animals. Poor access to vaccination services was significantly associated with not vaccinating livestock. Fear of adverse reactions to vaccines was not significantly associated with not vaccinating livestock. Respondents who reported that vets or animal health workers (AHWs) were their main source of animal health knowledge were significantly more likely to have immunised their livestock in the last twelve months. Participants cited poor communication from vaccinators as problematic, both in publicising immunisation programmes, and explaining the purpose of vaccination. Where vaccinations were provided free of charge, farmers commonly displayed passive attitudes to accessing vaccination services, awaiting organised "immunisation drives"rather than seeking vaccination themselves. Based on these findings the following recommendations are made to improve participation and effectiveness of immunisation programmes. Programmes should be planned to integrate with annual cycles of: disease risk, agricultural activity, seasonal climate, social calendar of villages; and maximise efficiency for vaccinators. Dates and times of immunisation in each village must be well publicised, as respondents frequently reported missing the vaccinators. Relevant farmer education should precede immunisation programmes to mitigate against poor knowledge or negative attitudes. Immunisation drives must properly engage beneficiaries, particularly ensuring that services are accessible to female livestock keepers, and sharing some responsibilities with local farmers. Payment of a small monetary contribution by animal keepers could be considered to encourage responsibility for disease prevention, making vaccination an active process by farmers.

	abstract = {Interactions between farmers and agrobiodiversity are key drivers of agroecosystems sustainability and of the resilience of such systems to perturbations, but research into the human/nature interactions have overlooked some important aspects of agrobiodiversity management. In particular, farmers' ecological knowledge of the spatial organisation of plant diversity remains an open question, although knowledge and practices have major implications for the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources. Our study addresses this question by analysing how farmers spatially organise plant species in agroforests based on their knowledge of species interactions and interactions with the environment. The Analanjirofo region on the north-east coast of Madagascar provides an interesting context to explore this issue in clove-based agroforests, as these systems were developed by farmers as a sustainable alternative to the traditional system of shifting rice cultivation. Using an emic approach, that is based on the farmers' perspective, and participatory mapping, we studied plant diversity and its spatial organisation in 17 clove-based agroforests and in 28 management sub-units defined by farmers in a village of Vavatenina district. The plant functions and farmers' knowledge of plant interactions with clove tree were recorded in semi-structured interviews, and the interactions were represented in a cognitive map. Farmers manage more than 50 plant species associated with diverse functions. Analysis of participatory maps identified four main types of species association as a function of the age of the clove trees and the associated plant diversity, and different spatial organisation patterns as a function of the topography and the surrounding species. Analysis of farmers' knowledge provided valuable insights into spatial organisation practices, how farmers perceive the adaptation of plant species to biophysical heterogeneity of the environment and whether they can be associated with other species. Our findings and methods pave the way for further interdisciplinary research on farmers/nature interactions to support the development of agrobiodiversity-based systems taking into account farmer and scientific knowledge and practices, especially in the tropics where the expansion of cash crops in input-intensive and mono-cropping systems has driven major disruptions to smallholder agriculture. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: High price volatility in agricultural commodities can be a major issue for value chain actors exposed to its adverse economic impacts. Price volatility results from the interaction of multiple factors linked within dynamic and complex agricultural systems. Therefore, to address price volatility, the approach needs to be capable of analysing feedback that occurs in such complex systems. OBJECTIVE: We integrate a systems thinking approach and value chain analysis to overcome the constraint of other methods to explicitly describe and understand how system structure influences system behaviour observed in price volatility and the assessment of the consequences of ex-ante and ex-post policy interventions based on this understanding. METHODS: The proposed integrated approach involves the active participation of value chain actors and stakeholders to improve their understanding of the complex systems they operate within including the policy environment. The approach takes the Indonesian chilli value chain as a case study. We implemented the first two steps of systems thinking (i.e., articulating problems and formulating dynamic hypotheses). In the group model building processes, we developed causal loop diagrams to represent a dynamic hypothesis that explains the feedback loops that cause price oscillation behaviour and systems archetypes that identify potential intervention points. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: The integrated approach was able to link the Indonesian chilli value chain's system structure and the system behaviour observed in price volatility. The causal loop diagram clearly displays the feedback between production, market governance, consumption, and price. The diagram also portrays how these factors impact value chain actors' performance and the influence of time delays and random shocks on the entire value chain system. Limits to growth and shifting the burden archetypes were identified as critical leverage points in formulating fundamental policy interventions to address price volatility. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the strengths of the proposed approach in developing a comprehensive dynamic qualitative model of a whole value chain system that influences the system behaviour, such as oscillation, which other modelling studies do not consider. The use of system archetypes to identify intervention points is another research contribution in that it improves value chain analysis. The results also highlight the benefits of participatory system dynamics modelling in enhancing the learning of value chain actors in anticipating the consequences of any actions or random shocks on the entire systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The demand for palm oil is steadily increasing where global consumption in 2020 has reached 77 million metric tons or equivalent to 7 kg of palm per capita usage. However, the industry is under critics for unsustainable production practice and environmental degradation due to unscrupulous deforestation. One of the measures taken to ensure sustainability practices in the industry in Malaysia includes certifications such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO). These certifications are offered to industry players/plantation giants in which all stakeholders/members need to fulfill stringent requirements in order to obtain the certification. Efforts are now being taken to ensure that every stakeholder in the palm oil industry obtain sustainable certification, and this includes effort to enable smallholders to also follow the guidelines and fulfill the certification requirements. However, as of 2021, only 30\% smallholders were certified despite the rigorous efforts made. Several factors may have hindered the participation of these smallholders. Hence, it is crucial that the agencies involved in managing this industry identify the factors influencing the certification of smallholders. The identification of these determinants will help policymakers to strengthen policy in disseminating sustainability practices in the palm oil industry. The objective of the current study is to identify factors influencing smallholders' participation in palm oil certification in Malaysia. This study looks beyond rational choice theory and develops a model based on elements of social structure and interaction. Quantitative approaches through questionnaire survey were used in this study. Purposive sampling was used, and data collections involved 200 oil palm smallholders in Malaysia. Four elements, namely, “Perceived Economic Benefit,” “Social Interaction,” “Shared Identity,” and “Communication Discourse,” were found to have significant influences on smallholders' participation in palm oil sustainable certification.

Through a multi-phase process of participatory activities, including auto-appraisal, participatory action research (PAR) and facilitated knowledge exchange, villagers and researchers worked together to document and develop a better understanding of the challenges and changes facing women and men in the region to generate social learning. Among these challenges, the degradation of forest resources due to over exploitation, weak governance and conflict of use over shea trees (Vitellaria paradoxa) were particularly important for women. The WAFFI approach created a scaffold for social learning that strengthened the capacity of local stakeholders to share their perspectives and opinions more effectively in multi-stakeholder forums and dialogue related to resource use and land use change initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {We assessed the effectiveness of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology in delivering biosecurity messages for the control of African swine fever (ASF) in Uganda using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 408 smallholder pig farmers. Our results show that IVR technology significantly improved knowledge of farmers who had not been exposed to training on biosecurity. Furthermore, it enhanced knowledge for farmers who had received face-to-face (f2f) training in biosecurity. This group of farmers recorded the highest knowledge gain following IVR training compared to farmers who did not receive f2f training. IVR technology was perceived by farmers as a new technology capable of transforming their lives because it is time efficient, has high potential for resource saving and flexibility. IVR also seems to be gender sensitive as it addresses some of the constraints women face in accessing conventional extension services such as time. IVR is an innovative way for delivery of advisory information to pig farmers. The scalability of IVR technology could further be explored and its feasibility assessed for wider use by the extension systems in Uganda and elsewhere. © Copyright © 2021 Dione, Kangethe, Poole, Ndiwa, Ouma and Dror.},

	abstract = {Decision Support Tools (DSTs) in agriculture have been widely developed but have not been well accepted by smallholder farmers. One reason for the limited use is that the tools do not account for the complexity of heterogeneous smallholder farming systems. Identifying farm typologies has facilitated technology transfer to target groups of farmers. Accounting for heterogeneity in farm systems can help in designing and deploying DSTs to address farmer needs. Typology analysis was applied to a 600-household survey dataset to identify different farm system types. Qualitative participatory research was used to assess the potential deployment of DSTs for fertilizer management. Six types of farm systems were identified with distinct characteristics in the study area of central Myanmar. Participatory research through focus group discussions with 34 participants from the six different farm types validated the farm typologies and found that farmers from one type considered that DSTs could be useful in gaining more information and knowledge. An important finding was that DSTs providing prescriptive advice were inconsistent with what many farmers want. Farmers indicated that discussion groups are a preferred learning-based approach rather than a prescriptive tool. Farmers preferred video clips and infographics integrated into existing familiar digital platforms. This study identifies heterogeneity within a large farm sample and develops a deeper understanding of fertilizer decisions as well as knowledge and intentions related to the use of DSTs or apps via follow-up focus group discussions. Incorporating a participatory research framework with typology identification can have a beneficial role in direct interactions with smallholders that may increase their acceptability of DSTs. This study has generated valuable information about farmer types and serves as a starting point for developing a framework for discussion support systems that may better relate to the needs of farmers. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The creation of commercialization opportunities for smallholder farmers has taken primacy on the development agenda of many developing countries. Invariably, most of the smallholders are less productive than commercial farmers and continue to lag in commercialization. Apart from the various multifaceted challenges which smallholder farmers face, limited access to extension services stands as the underlying constraint to their sustainability. Across Africa and Asia, public extension is envisioned as a fundamental part of the process of transforming smallholder farmers because it is their major source of agricultural information. Extension continues to be deployed using different approaches which are evolving. For many decades, various authors have reported the importance of the approaches that effectively revitalize extension systems and have attempted to fit them into various typologies. However, there is a widespread concern over the inefficiency of these extension approaches in driving the sustainability of smallholder farming agenda. Further, most of the approaches that attempted to revolutionize extension have been developed and brought into the field in rapid succession, but with little or no impact at the farmer level. This paper explores the theory and application of agricultural extension approaches and argues the potential of transforming them using digital technologies. The adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as mobile phones and the internet which are envisaged to revolutionize existing extension systems and contribute towards the sustainability of smallholder farming systems is recommended. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Farmers make livelihood and landholding decisions within institutional contexts that deliver and shape access to resources they need. I develop an ‘institutional-benefit-pathway framework’ to help explain the politics of resource distribution and how farmers access resources that support their livelihoods, such as seeds, farmland improvement technology, and microcredit. Based on qualitative evidence collected over 16 months of fieldwork among 212 smallholder households and 60+ civic, state, and market institutions in Telangana, India, this paper identifies three pathways: a state pathway illustrated by a millet promotion initiative; a state-civic society pathway highlighted by watershed management; and a state-civic society-market pathway that delivers climate information and microcredit, while promoting pesticide-free agricultural practice. Benefit pathway analysis reveals the institutional rules and roles that demarcate direction and access to benefits by illustrating the complexities of local institutional interaction and the roles of institutional power in access to resources. The cases show that state and NGO actors hold disproportionate influence over resource distribution, while smallholders are largely unable to influence the development policy process. Smallholders are, in this context, unable to correct the unevenness in benefit distribution, and affect the type of benefits, which are all ironically meant for them. However, the cases also uncover mechanisms that farmers use to gain access to resources. Results suggest that mere partnership of state and non-state actors will not necessarily lead to better development outcomes and that institutionally mediated benefits are as vulnerable to capture from powerful institutions as they are from local elites. Through the cases, I argue that development assistance is more effective and equitable when farmers are able to influence the elements and distribution of benefits. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Field data on current crop postharvest management practices and perceptions from smallholder farming communities in an increasingly variable climate are scarce. Our study used a multi-dimensional approach to explore the practices and perceptions of these communities and their service-providers regarding grain postharvest management in semi-arid Mbire and Hwedza districts in Zimbabwe. A total of 601 individual household interviews, six focus group discussions with women and men, and interviews with 40 district stakeholders and 53 community key informants were conducted. Farmers and service-providers explained how climate change was threatening food security; causing reduced and more variable maize and sorghum yields of below 0.5 t/ha, alongside higher grain storage insect pest pressure. Increased food insecurity and concerns regarding grain theft have driven a shift from bulk storage in traditional outdoor free-standing granaries to polypropylene bags stacked inside the living quarters. Poor and improper use of synthetic pesticides in these circumstances exacerbates the health-related risks. Agricultural extension officers were the most common source of agronomic and postharvest information followed by farmer-to-farmer information exchange. Targeted postharvest training; participatory field trials involving agricultural extension staff, farmers and other service-providers; and policy dialogue around grain postharvest management and food security are proposed to help in strengthening the capacity to reduce grain postharvest losses under increasingly unpredictable conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

Through the efforts of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), there have been initiatives to improve agricultural productivity in Africa and Zimbabwe in particular. One such intervention has been the AIPs that seek to bring together all stakeholders who can meaningfully contribute to the improvement of agriculture. Using largely qualitative approaches, data was collected through interviews from small scale farmers as well as different actors who were involved in the AIPs. The respondents in the study also included NGO workers, academic researchers, government workers, traditional leaders, agricultural financiers, extension workers and state-owned institutions. Using Norman Long’s interface analysis as the central theoretical framework, key findings showed that communal areas were active communities that had their own socio-economic network systems which govern how smallholder farmers operate. It also emerged that IPs are a result of a combination of the social and the formal/institutionalised structures that interacted in Hwedza. The paper concludes that IPs were established in Hwedza through a series of interactive processes among actors and these were not always smooth and successful. © The Author(s) 2020.},

A sample size of 250 smallholders was randomly selected from a total of 687 smallholders in Trieu Phong district, Central Vietnam. A two-section questionnaire was used to gather data. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. The smallholders used mobile phones, TV and radio networks/broadcasts as the common ICT tools, and these were also effective ICT tools for accessing agricultural information. Lack of knowledge and skills for using applications on mobile phones were the main challenge to the smallholders’ use of ICT.

This study is guided by the questions posed by local coffee farmers themselves: How can one successfully shift away from wasteful and harmful practices to those that support the health of the family, community, and environment? We track how El Toledo Coffee Farm in Costa Rica has harnessed natural systems and knowledge sharing, facilitated by international travel to transform challenges into opportunities. Here, we highlight how this family-run coffee farm has (1) implemented agroecological methods, (2) harnessed economic benefits of processing organic coffee and developing innovative products from coffee fruits, and (3) examine psychological factors that have made these transformations possible. By examining the development of integrated coffee production from three distinct academic perspectives, we found that mental flexibility and receptiveness to new ideas, combined with an appreciation of sustainable, traditional practices and values, have spawned various beneficial agroecological practices. These ideas and practices were often initiated by interactions with visitors to the farm, supporting the idea that globalization can foster sustainable food systems and promote collective ecological action through knowledge transfer and shared concern for local environments and communities. The mentality of embracing challenges as opportunities to invest in healthy soils and agroforestry and expand their business model by offering tours and varied products replicates ecological resilience attained through diversity. © 2021 by the Regents of the University of California.

The main objectives of this study were to identify the key information exchange agents, understand the information flow path, rank the relative importance of the different information dissemination pathways, and determine weather forecast adoption. We conducted a household survey in five villages of Rim Kebele in Bahir Dar area and found that farmers communicate with four main agents with regard to information exchange. We developed an agent-based model to learn the adoption rates of weather forecast information. Agriculture extension agents were found to be the most influential members of the community. Farmers’ communicating with neighboring village farmers showed higher adoption. Our results show at least twice that improvements in communication network attain higher adoption rates. Radio has also demonstrated positive uptake of information. We also found that forecast accuracy of 70\% is sufficient to achieve high adoption rates. Our findings might help decision-makers recognize critical information flow pathways and their relative importance, and identify barriers to disseminating weather forecast information in the community. © 2021 by the authors.

A total of 384 soil samples were selected from representative farmers’ fields and analysed for soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and quality, as well as nutrient contents, using midDRIFTS (mid-infrared diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy) and wet chemistry analyses. MidDRIFTS was also used to calculate SOC stability indexes as SOC quality proxies. ‘Market distance’ and ‘farm typology’ were key determinants of soil fertility variability, both with contrasting trends in Bushumba and Mushinga. Decreasing soil fertility with increasing market distance was noted across all farm typologies. ‘Farm typology’ was related to exchangeable calcium and magnesium, while ‘site’ resulted in a difference of plant available phosphorus. SOC quality indexes were related to ‘site’, interacting with ‘market distance’. A ‘market distance’ effect became obvious in the medium wealthy and poor farms of Mushinga, where a lower SOC quality in remote fields plots was noted with increasing market distance. In agreement with farmers’ indigenous knowledge, soil fertility levels were higher in deep than shallow soils, which were reflected in higher nutrient stocks in deep soils receiving organic amendments. Our results inferred that soil fertility variability across smallholder farms must consider various inter-related determinants as basis for site-specific fertility management interventions. © 2020 The Authors.

This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production. © The Author(s) 2020.},

The government has tried to prevent and control the disease by vaccination, but it has not yet given effective results. Therefore, another attempt to prevent the recurrence of CSF cases is to apply biosecurity in pig farms by looking for risk factors associated with on-farm and off-farm contact. This study aims to determine the contact rate and investigate the risk factors associated with on-farm and off-farm contact in commercial and smallholder pig farms in Karanganyar, Central Java, Indonesia, in the context of controlling CSF disease. Materials and Methods: This study used a cross-sectional study design in which the pig farm was designed as the observed epidemiological unit. The contact structure data were conducted by sampling using a two-stage random method. We selected Karanganyar district because it is the center of a pig farm in the Central Java Province and has many CSF cases in several years before. The study was conducted for more or less 1 month from August to September 2019. The contact data were collected from 37 smallholder farms and 27 commercial farms within interviews. Risk factors for contact with pigs were analyzed using logistic regression using theStatistix Program version 8.0 (www.statistix.com). Results: In comparison to smallholder farms, commercial farms had 2.38 and 3.32 times higher contact rate in outside farms and inside farms, respectively. Two factors increased the risk for on-farm contacts including commercials type farm (p=0.0012; odds ratio [OR]=8.32) with contact rate of 1.24 times/day and the time interval of CSF vaccination for 1-3 months (p=0.0013; OR=8.43) with contact rate of 0.98 times/day, and three factors increased the risk for off-farm contacts including the commercial farm type (p=0.012; OR=4.88) with 1.50 contact/day, the time interval of CSF vaccination for 1-3 months (p=0.036; OR=3.83) with 1.30 contact/day, and farmers with experience in pig husbandry {\textless}5 years (p=0.075; OR=3.56) with 1.13 contact/day. Conclusion: This study shows that commercial farms and short CSF vaccination intervals increased the risk of either off-farm or on-farm contacts. The contact structure of pig farms in Karanganyar district is similar to that in other areas in Indonesia. Reducing the risk of contacts either outside or inside the pig farms is essential to prevent disease transmission. Enhancing communication and education to pig farmers and surveillance is also necessary to prevent such diseases in pigs. © 2021 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Growing numbers of developing countries are investing in National Evaluation Systems (NESs). A key question is whether these have the potential to bring about meaningful policy change, and if so, what evaluation approaches are appropriate to support reflection and learning throughout the change process. Objectives: We describe the efforts of commissioned external evaluators in developing an evaluation approach to help critically assess the efficacy of some of the most important policies and programmes aimed at supporting South African farmers from the past two decades. Method: We present the diagnostic evaluation approach we developed. The approach guides evaluation end users through a series of logical steps to help make sense of an existing evidence base in relation to the root problems addressed, and the specific needs of the target populations.No additional evaluation data were collected. Groups who participated include government representatives, academics and representatives from non-governmental organisations and national associations supporting emerging farmers. Results: Our main evaluation findings relate to a lack of policy coherence in important key areas, most notably extension and advisory services, and microfinance and grants. This wascharacterised by; (1) an absence of common understanding of policies and objectives; (2) overly ambitious objectives often not directly linked to the policy frameworks; (3) lack of logical connections between target groups and interventions and (4) inadequate identification, selection, targeting and retention of beneficiaries. Conclusion: The diagnostic evaluation allowed for uniquely cross-cutting and interactive engagement with a complex evidence base.

Education on sustainable management involves complex interactions and communication flows among information providers and practitioners. Farmer practice is often overlooked within extension knowledge systems, resulting in incompatible recommendations and barriers to sustainable agriculture. This study investigates the diversity of smallholder agricultural practices, with a focus on maize-legume systems in Tanzania, including seasonal cropping patterns and management, as well as linkages to extension recommendations and information flows. We used a mixed methods approach to assess the state of extension and farmer practice around maize-legume production in Tanzania. Household and plot-level survey data (n = 220) and focus group discussions (n = 5) and extension information was ascertained through interviews with key stakeholders (n = 12) and a survey of village-based extension advisors (n = 193). We found legume management practices were highly local. In the Southern Highlands for example, farmers produced from one to three bean crops per year, using a range of planting arrangements. Further, extension recommendations often did not take into account the varieties, fertilizer or plant spacing used by farmers. This comprehensive study of extension knowledge systems in Tanzania highlights the persistent disconnects that occur at multiple levels, acting as a barrier to sustainable intensification of smallholder farming. © 2021 The Author(s).

The recurring drought is a major challenge to smallholder livestock farmers in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. This study assesses the perception of smallholder livestock farmers towards agricultural drought resilience. The study utilised a perception index score using primary data collected from 207 smallholder livestock farmers following a structured questionnaire survey and multistage sampling procedures. The study found that the average perception index of the role of social networks and government to enhance agricultural drought resilience was negative, which implied that their role in enhancing resilience towards agricultural drought was insufficient. However, the perception of smallholder livestock farmers on the role of social networks was lower than the role of government. This study recommends coordination and cooperation amongst all role players to reinforce strategies to enhance smallholder livestock farmers’ resilience. This includes coordinator amongst the local, provincial government, African Farmers’ Association of South Africa, extension officers, private sectors, monitoring agencies in terms of reliable early warning information and communication amongst decision-makers. Collaboration amongst government departments at the national and provincial levels should be strengthening to enhance farmer’s resilience. The collaboration includes the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries at the national level, Provincial Departments of Agriculture, National and Provincial Disaster Management Centres, South African Weather Service and Department of Water Affairs. Smallholder livestock farmers’ awareness of the significance of social networking and government participation should be promoted. © 2021. The Author. Licensee: AOSIS.

However, farmers' awareness on the food safety risk is limited, affecting their on-farm activities. Thus, this study was conducted to assess and compare the farmers' perceptions on food safety issues and risks caused by the management and practices at layer farms. Design/methodology/approach: Farmers from 143 farms certified by National Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) standard and 59 non-GAP farms were interviewed using a structured questionnaire for risk perception evaluation. Their level of perceived risk was compared using a scoring system. Findings: The food safety hazards in eggs seem to be fairly recognized by both groups of farmers. GAP farmers demonstrated a higher risk of food safety incidences caused by inappropriate management and practices in farms than non-GAP farmers (p {\textless} 0.001). Although the results did not confirm the strong connection between risk perception and risk reduction behavior, these findings are beneficial to the food safety policy implementers to evaluate the critical issues for risk communication and for knowledge dissemination activities. The influence of other internal and external factors on farmers' food safety-related behavior should be further investigated. Research limitations/implications: The impact limitation was identified due to the restriction of scope on a specific population and region. The target respondents did not cover all scales, especially the backyard and smallholder farmers nor other rearing systems, such as free-range productions. Originality/value: The knowledge regarding the food safety practices by egg producing farmers in Thailand is limited. Notably, this study contributes to the literature in elucidating the preventive behavior of food handlers and all stakeholders in the Thai food supply chain. The implementations of food safety preventive measures by two groups of farmers, GAP-certified and non-GAP-certified farmers, will guide policymakers to intervene more successfully regarding the appropriate changes needed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Objectives Coinciding with the outbreak of the economic crisis that began in 2008, in Catalonia there has been a continued growth of socio-economic initiatives within the framework of Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), a sector characterised by significant female participation. In a context of high economic and vital vulnerability women have generated, amongst other, responses aimed at satisfying individual and collective needs through cooperative management. Within the ‘Crisis and female alternatives’ research project we have analysed such socio-economic alternatives led by women in Catalonia from the Feminist Economics (FE) conceptual framework, in order to understand to what extent they may be reproducing social inequalities. As a contribution to the dialogue between SSE and FE, we have addressed this concern by reflecting on the degree of democratisation of the SSE sector in Catalonia in terms of its inclusiveness, i.e. the existing options to access it. Our main research question is what does it mean to democratize the economy from the feminist perspective? In this article we address the hypothetical absence of inequalities reproduction in two ways: in terms of the participation of the socio-economically disadvantaged sectors, as well as in terms of the overcoming of the hierarchy between the productive and reproductive dimensions of the economy Methods In order to identify the axes of inequality that constrain the real possibilities for the participation of women in SSE, we have interviewed and analysed the profile of 17 women in four areas of SEE activity: care and attention to people (7 initiatives), agroecology (4), housing (3), and construction of community networks (3). The SSE experiences analysed are located either in the Barcelona metropolitan region or in Central Catalonia. The selection of these four areas is motivated by the fact that they develop an economic activity that unifies production and reproduction in the resolution of diverse needs. The simultaneous approach to both spheres of socio-economic experiences is a premise of the Feminist Economics conceptual and analytical framework. The first group includes initiatives for the care of the elderly, people in a situation of functional dependence and young children. The second group includes initiatives for the consumption, processing and/or distribution of agroecological food. The third group includes two housing cooperatives (one under construction and the other in the project development phase at the time of the fieldwork). Finally, the fourth group includes initiatives that seek to promote and build interpersonal and/or community links. The selection of the initiatives was made after a preliminary mapping in each territory of SSE experiences in the four sectors of interest and ease of access to informants. In terms of format, the initiatives include 6 associations, 7 cooperatives, 1 self-managed parenting group, 1 family farming enterprise, 1 trade union and 1 platform. All but one are small-format initiatives, in line with the majority profile of SSE initiatives in Catalonia, which are small and cooperative in format. This sample was complemented by 5 interviews with informants from three key sectors for the development of the SSE in Catalonia: public administration (socio-economic innovation), Cooperative Athenaeums and ethical finance. All interviews were recorded with the informed consent of the interviewees and subsequently anonymised and coded for in-depth qualitative analysis using Atlas.ti. Results The results presented in this article suggest that the SSE, as it is currently organized, presents limitations or difficulties in reversing some of the inequalities on which the capitalist market economy is built, both productive and reproductive. In particular, the analysis of the interviews with women participating in cooperative projects suggests that in the generation of socioeconomic alternatives within the SSE, inequalities of access are reproduced along five axes: socio-economic level, educational level, place of origin, family responsibilities, and political-relational capital. This result is also supported by the key informants interviewed. In the area of productive or paid work, socioeconomic level, together with educational level and relational capital, are determinants for access to these alternatives. The participation in the SSE of the women interviewed is not explained so much by the urgency of responding to basic needs as by the capacity for collective action and the presence of other resources such as capital, education and relationships. Women with more precarious socioeconomic profiles do not have a significant presence in cooperative initiatives. Thus, what drives most of these initiatives is more the ideological commitment to a certain way of generating employment and economic activity than a need for self-employment per se. Origin articulates a fourth axis of inequality, since women of non-EU origin are practically absent from the SSE. Likewise, the (few) women of non-EU origin who work in cooperative projects develop activities linked to reproductive and care work, socio-labour insertion or specific work with the migrant population, all sectors characterized by their low social value and high labour precariousness. In the area of the unpaid or reproductive economy, we analysed the ability to reconcile a paid activity with family care responsibilities, following the contributions of the FE, which takes into consideration all the work necessary for subsistence, well-being and social reproduction. Thus, although the need to reconcile work with family life and caregiving responsibilities seems to be an important reason for many women to join the SSE, this expectation is often frustrated and only materializes in certain situations or family situations. As a generator of inequalities in access, the options available for managing family responsibilities also have an impact on the possibilities for women to become involved in the SSE, as well as on the conditions under which they do so. If these first two dimensions show important weaknesses when it comes to facilitating economic alternatives in the SSE field, the last factor analysed, relational capital, appears as a key factor in explaining participation in this field, combined with an important ideological motivation and the presence of resources for collective action. Conclusions, original value and limitations This article contributes to fill the lack of empirical studies that analyse in detail the SSE sector. As an added value, the originality of this contribution lies in the fact that it is framed in the dialogue between SSE and Feminist Economics. These are two critical economy sectors on the rise that, although sharing the proposal of alternative socioeconomic models that place people’s lives and needs at the centre of economic activity, they diverge in the scope of their transformative potential. We have sought to deepen the democratizing project of the economy claimed by the SSE from the FE framework. Assuming non-reproduction of inequalities as the objective of any socioeconomic project that is considered transformative, we have problematized the feminization of SSE to detect inequalities of access and identify which women are most favoured for participation in this type of alternative economic initiatives. Our results suggest that the SSE, as it is currently organized, presents limitations or difficulties in reversing some of the inequalities on which the capitalist market economy is built, both productive and reproductive, showing weaknesses when it comes to facilitating economic alternatives for women. Consequently, we can affirm that the transformative potential of the SSE as a democratizing alternative for the economy is called into question if we analyse its degree of inclusiveness, since there is a risk of generating a model that is only accessible to certain socioeconomic profiles. Addressing this risk is a major challenge for the sector. In this regard, our results suggest the relevance and need to deepen the analysis of socioeconomic processes from currently non-hegemonic perspectives. Among them, the FE perspective allows us to problematize these processes, explicitly incorporating their reproductive dimension. This critical view is particularly necessary in areas that are intended to be transformative, such as the SSE. Among other issues, as future lines of work to address the challenge of feminist democratization of the SSE, we identified the need to explore the degree of recognition of reproductive work in cooperative initiatives beyond the discursive, i.e., if and how this recognition is operationalized. Likewise, it is necessary to continue exploring the tension between vital (personal) time and commercial (collective) time involved in the work overload that women in the SSE report. Addressing the precariousness of women’s work and life in the SSE sector involves identifying, among other things, innovative formulas for care co-responsibility and time use that are not currently being generated. The FE also allows us to highlight non-monetarized socioeconomic practices. In this sense, a closer look at the processes of mutual support and empowerment often linked to women’s participation in SSE is particularly interesting. Continuing to advance in the analysis of the convergences and divergences between SSE and FE would finally allow us to analyse whether and how the SSE is responding to women’s productive and reproductive economic needs. Indeed, this last key issue is related to the limitations we can bring up related to our study, as this approach to both productive and reproductive dimensions of the economy is a challenge both conceptually, when combining conventional and non-conventional indicators and empirically, when analysing socioeconomic initiatives. Addressing this challenge is, at the same time, a main contribution of the research here presented. © 2021. CIRIEC-España.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to quantify the economic potential of grass-based milk production strategies with limited use of concentrated feed in the pre-alpine region. We monitored 36 family dairy farms from the pre-alpine region of Switzerland divided in three study groups following one of three defined, voluntarily adopted production strategies: Partial grazing and barn feeding with freshly cut forages, supplementing {\textless}500 kg (GBF) and 1,200 kg (GBFplus) of concentrated feed, respectively, and practicing full grazing (FG), supplementing {\textless}100 kg of concentrated feed per cow per year. For three years (2014–2016), data were collected on the farms, and experience and ideas were exchanged and evaluated in a participatory process together with local extension services and researchers. Economic success indicators such as cost price and return to labor from each study group were compared with structurally similar control groups derived from the Swiss Farm Accountancy Data Network after completing an interactive standardization process, which largely balanced farm-specific features in the study groups. Compared with the control groups, the cost price (Swiss francs [CHF] per 100 kg milk) of GBF, GBFplus, and FG was significantly reduced by 20\%, 20\%, and 26\%, respectively. Return to labor (CHF per hour) was significantly higher than in the control group for GBF (20.60 versus. 13.80), GBFplus (19.70 versus. 10.20), and FG (29.30 versus. 19.20). The comparison between the study groups also showed that lower milk revenues due to a lower use of concentrate could be economically compensated by a better input efficiency. A consistent implementation of the production strategy as well as personal qualities in terms of cost management seems to play a decisive role. © 2021 Japanese Society of Grassland Science},

This study aimed at investigating the factors that determine adaptation choices using multivariate and ordered econometric models. It also examined the complementarity and substitutability of adaptation strategies using primary data collected from 383 smallholder farmers in North-Western Ethiopia. Our findings revealed adoption complimentary but no evidence of substitutability among adaptation strategies. The multivariate probit model estimation showed that household heads education level, gender, farmland soil fertility, access to extension service, credit access, climate information and key assets ownership are the key determinants of adoptions. The likelihood of adoption decreased when average long-term rainfall increased. In terms of the interaction effect between gender and access to credit, the study found that women-headed households with access to credit were more likely to use a higher number of adaptation strategies relative to women-headed households without access to credit. The significant factors for each strategy were different that entails how important it is to consider their unique characteristics in policy design and interventions. As per the finding, policy makers should consider gender-disaggregated interventions. It is also highly imperative to increase information access, basic education and extension service to boost farmers’ adaptation practices. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Studies have determined the factors influencing agricultural drought resilience of smallholder farmers and implications for empowerment. Other than the Abbreviated Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI), studies do not provide an analysis of cultural or traditional beliefs and reflective dialogues on challenges of smallholder female livestock farmers. This study uses a mixed approach that includes a survey, A-WEAI, Pearson's chi-square coefficient, and reflective dialogue to analyze these challenges. The ability to adapt to agricultural drought is influenced by factors such as access to information, credit, productive resources, and available time, all of which are different for men and women. Our study found that 61.3\% and 16.4\% of the female and male farmers were disempowered. Domains that contributed the most to the disempowerment of the women and men were respectively time/workload (52.97\% and 31.89\%), access to and decisions on credit (17.7\% and 21.4\%), ownership of assets (11.3\% and 8.5\%), input into productive decisions (10\% and 9.1\%) and group membership (8\% and 19.13\%). No significant correlation for age, marital status, or level of education versus empowerment status of women was found. A significant correlation was observed between farming experience and the empowerment status of women. Reflective dialogue during interviews revealed that women struggled with access to finance, grazing, water, stock theft, lack of training and knowledge, and intimidation by male neighbors. Such findings help inform agricultural development strategies to develop or modify existing policies to enhance the resilience of farmers to agricultural drought and empowerment. Gender-specific agricultural projects should be encouraged to empower female farmers to improve their resilience to agricultural drought. The government should assist female livestock farmers in accessing credit and developing clear policies on land tenure issues. Mentorship programs should be encouraged to educate and support female smallholder farmers to enhance their agricultural drought resilience and empowerment. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

	abstract = {This exploratory study assesses factors that harness agricultural technology adoption among smallholder farmers in Kakamega County, Kenya by evaluating the key variables that influence sustainable adoption of agricultural innovations in the area. A survey was randomly administered in June and July 2018 among smallholder farming households in seven sub-counties (N=78) of Kakamega County. A logistic regression model, capturing factors presumed to influence the adoption of agricultural innovations, was estimated. Results suggest that even in smallholder farms, the farm size is important in adoption of innovations. Results also indicate limited or no farmer interaction (55\%) with extension services. Farmers reported application of fertilizer and use of push-pull technology as less important in maintaining soil health. The regression model findings suggest that variables typically presumed to influence adoption in the literature are insignificant in this case study. The statistical significance of the farm size variable implies that agricultural extension messages can be tailored to a variety of farmer audiences for suitable adoption based on farm size. The diffusion of innovation theory remains a valid and relevant framework in studying adoption. This study reiterates the critical role that farmers or their environment play in the adoption process. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Officially recognized in Chile since 2007, PGS certification has grown in momentum in recent years. We used semi-structured interviews, surveys and participant observations to shed light on the PGS movement in Chile and the respective governance framework. Our results indicate that after PGS formalization, Chilean PGS initiatives struggle to comply with wide-ranging administrative procedures similar to those requested for third-party certification (TPC). Furthermore, lacking resources among PGS initiatives inhibit the PGS movement from impacting the national discourse. We present two PGS initiatives and their organizational structures, exploring ‘who’ participate, ‘how’ participation occurs, and ‘what kind’ of participation takes place. Our results indicate that the interaction as well as the exchange of knowledge among PGS members is a central benefit perceived by PGS participants. However, regular PGS member participation is hindered by the required time investment, the distance that PGS members need to travel and the perceived lacking expertise they have. © 2021 The Author(s).

As there are significant differences in economic development, natural resources and agricultural productivity within the region, we estimate the Livelihood Vulnerability Index in two districts (Vaishali, Bihar and Karnal, Haryana) to determine suitable adaptation strategies under diverse conditions. To reflect different aspects of climate exposure, we include both self-reported climate shocks and spatially interpolated weather data. The assessment of 1127 households shows that while both districts have similar exposure and adaptive capacity levels, the sensitivity dimension makes Vaishali more vulnerable to climate change. To reduce sensitivity, decision-makers should focus on improving infrastructure (e.g., permanent housing, latrines, health centers, alternative energy sources). To improve adaptive capacity and reduce climate risk in both regions, policymakers should promote the expansion of extension training for livelihood diversification, information and communication technologies as well as conservation agriculture. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This paper explores key elements of an extension approach for enhancing the sustainability and realizing the scaling-up of tree growing by smallholder farmers in rural remote areas where extension services seldom reach and access to external markets is difficult. By referring to the case in Madagascar, the paper discusses that creating a certain number of local trainers is effective because they function as a driver to promote tree growing and new livelihood activities introduced by external agents using locally available resources. One critical issue of being a local trainer is to have good communication skills in relation to fellow farmers. This issue can be addressed by sharing the importance of communication skills of local trainers in a community so that fellow farmers can facilitate local trainers’ reflection unless a farmer does not feel reliable to a local trainer. On a mid- to longer-term basis, income opportunities will become an important point of motivation for local trainers. Creating new livelihood activities that can generate income and simultaneously contribute to village development is the way to go. This will enable local trainers to maintain their motivation and thus lead to sustainable tree growing activities. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

In particular, they enable experiments to be conducted that are not practical or feasible to conduct in real world settings; they can capture heterogeneity in agent circumstances, knowledge, behaviour, and experiences; and they facilitate a multi-scale, causal understanding of system dynamics. However, developing detailed, empirically informed agent-based models is typically a time and resource intensive activity. Here, we describe a detail-rich, ethnographically informed agent-based model of a Nepalese smallholder village that was created for the purpose of studying the impact of multiple stressors on mountain communities. In doing so, we aim to make the model accessible to other researchers interested in simulating such communities and to provide inspiration for other socio-ecological system modellers. • The model is described using the ODD protocol. • The number of replicate runs required for experiments is discussed, and the model validation and sensitivity analysis processes that have been conducted are explained. • Suggestions are made for how the model can practically be used and for how model outputs can be analysed. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: Enhancing the relevance of rural extension services requires aligning extension education to the roles, tasks, activities and competencies of smallholder farmers. The objective of this study is to follow up on previous competence studies and to construct a validated competence framework. Design/Methodology/Approach: Competence frameworks are generally being used to articulate performance requirements for certain jobs or professions. Whereas most competence frameworks display generic competencies and long lists of tasks, this study combines generic competencies, behavioural aspects, and content specifications of the job fields. The competence framework was empirically validated through workshops, focus-group discussions, and surveys involving 76 participants from stakeholder groups. Findings: The results reveal nine roles: 1. Learner, 2. Manager, 3. Communicator, 4. Co-operator, 5. Professional, 6. Innovator, 7. Entrepreneur, 8. Planner, and 9. Producer. Furthermore, six job fields are defined, based on the content of the farmers' jobs: 1. Pre-planting, 2. During-planting, 3. After-planting, 4. During-harvesting, 5. Post-harvesting, and 6. Facilitating all farming activities. Combining the roles and the job fields results in the identification of 23 tasks and 25 competencies. Practical implications: The competence framework validated in this study can serve as a starting point for extension workers to develop courses, training programs, and interactions with smallholder farmers. Theoretical implications: The study demonstrates a research approach involving the contextualization of competencies, rendering them meaningful for improving rural innovation and the productivity of smallholder farming. Originality/Value: The integrated approach used to develop the competence framework can be applied in any other context, and result in a comprehensive understanding of the respective job/profession. © 2021 Wageningen University.},

Little attention has been given to other areas of the farming value chain. To address this shortcoming, this study adopts an interpretive approach, to assess the influence of mobile phone use in farming and its effect on the livelihoods of poor rural farmers. Analysing interviews from farmers in a rural Nigerian agrarian community based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA), the findings reveal that the ease of communications, social interactions, improved farm skills and knowledge afforded by mobile phone use leads to improved opportunities for farmers. These opportunities resonate in the entire farming value chain thereby enhancing farmers’ livelihoods. However, some human capital deficiencies and contextual factors bordering on language barrier, lack of capability and awareness in the use of mobile phone features and functionalities inhibit farmers from benefiting optimally from the leverages provided by mobile phones. This calls for policies geared towards capacity building and sensitization of the rural populace on the prospects of mobile phone use in farming. © 2021 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.},

Using attributes derived from positive psychological capital as proxies for entrepreneurship and data collected from 458 smallholders in and around irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal, the study empirically examines factors affecting smallholder engagement in entrepreneurship activities. Findings show that access to extension and information from scheme committees, being a male farmer, having more earned income, membership to a cooperative and access to markets have a positive effect on farmers' entrepreneurial behaviour. Factors inhibiting entrepreneurship in the context of smallholder farming include land tenure insecurity, access to land without the necessary complementary resources, consumption credit and staying far away from irrigation schemes. The study recommends addressing gender bias regarding access to resources and information. Promoting interactive learning through networking will also result in positive entrepreneurial behaviour. There is also a need for the provision of demand-driven extension services, facilitation of market linkages and enhancing access to finance for would-be entrepreneurs. Access to credit should be directly linked to agricultural production through input vouchers and value chain financing. Addressing land tenure issues along with access to other complementary resources, inputs and services will also enhance on-farm entrepreneurship in the smallholder agriculture sector. © 2020},

Based on the global Moran’s I test, the Bayesian spatial Durbin probit model(BSDPM) was constructed, the appropriate spatial weight matrix was set, the optimal model for parameter estimation was selected, and the direct and spatial spillover effects of family farm characteristics on GCTs adoption behavior of family farms were decomposed by means of the partial differential method. The results show that the GCTs adoption behaviors of adjacent family farmers are spatially correlated and strongest when they are within 2.0 km of each other. Farm leaders’ educational level, degree of risk preference, financial status, number of laborers, understanding of GCTs and of the dangers of chemical pesticides, knowledge of other GCT adopters, frequency of communication with neighbors, participation in technical training and the strength of media publicity have significantly positive effects on the GCT adoption behaviors of family farms, which are mainly influenced by the direct effects of characteristic variables. However, the spatial spillover effects of neighboring family farmers’ participation in technical training, number of laborers, and financial status cannot be ignored. This result provides not only theoretical support for the demonstration and extension of the effectiveness of GCTs but also a reference for the selection of family farms as model households. © 2020 Taylor \& Francis.},

The literature was examined for the role of citizen science in supporting sustainable agriculture activities, pointing to opportunities, challenges, and recommendations. The study identified the following gaps: insufficient attention to (1) long-term capacity building and dialogue between academics and farming communities; (2) developing countries in the global South and smallholders; (3) agriculture trading and marketing; (4) the rationales of selecting target groups; (5) contributing to accelerated sustainability transitions. The main aim of the research projects reviewed in this study tended to focus on the research outcomes from an academic perspective, not sustainable solutions in practice or sustainability in general.

The Philippine government’s investment in the modernization of PAGASA is consistent with a substantial international effort in weather and climate science. However, these improvements are only of value if they can be communicated and used in decision-making. Collectively the 12 papers in this special issue offer insights into the process of creating value from PAGASA information for smallholder farmers. These 12 papers are drawn from case studies in two contrasting farming systems: high-value vegetable production in Benguet, and the corn and rice production in Mindoro. The papers have a common focus on the use of weather and climate information for smallholder farmers, but they apply various methods from the social sciences (social network analysis, key informant interviews, gender analysis) and applied economics (risk matrices, simulation model, decision analysis, and value of information). The resulting insights are cross-disciplinary, consisting of a research team of Philippine and Australian colleagues, cross-national. We conclude this synthesis paper by drawing together what was learned in specific contexts and what this might offer other applied researchers in the Philippines, Australia and globally as they seek to make the advances in climate science useful to decision makers. © 2020, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

	abstract = {To construct more sustainable ways of using coastal resources, collaboration between society, decision makers, and scientists is highly advocated. Some social sectors consider that scientists do not adequately participate in the problems of society, and that although scientific knowledge continues to grow, socioecological problems are worsening. The generation of scientific knowledge, as well as its dissemination to address societal problems, should go beyond what traditionally has been done. The exchange of information among stakeholders is essential in the management of socioecological systems and the importance of understanding these flows is increasingly recognized. We investigated the role that scientific research has played in small-scale fisheries on the southern coast of Jalisco, Mexico. We used Social Network Analysis to visualize and understand the information flow between three sectors: fishers, academia, and government. Our findings suggest that the geographical distance between the actors plays an important role and defines many of the interactions between the sectors. In addition, distrust, language differences, lack of cooperation and leadership within the fishing organizations, and a lack of empathy between the actors, are all obstacles that actors face when discussing actions plans. The governmental sector has the ability to collect and disseminate information, yet it has not done enough to share the information in an effective way. While academia is a reliable and constant source of information, it has a peripheral role in the social network and there is a lack of communication strategies in place to enable the data generated to be utilized effectively. This study may provide an alternative pathway for research institutions to understand their role when examining issues in the regions where they work. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Rural households mitigate risks through both individual and collective strategies that have proven viable for establishing long-term adaptive capacities. However, while the importance of social interactions has been acknowledged, there has been little in-depth empirical research on the influence of collective structures on vulnerable livelihoods. Based on research with smallholders in rural Vietnam, this paper explores how social capital deployed through informal collective actions compares with the effects of formal collective organisations for the overall adaptive capacity. We apply a mixed-methods approach combining a rich survey dataset from three rural provinces, and qualitative interviews with farmers in four case study villages. The results reveal the emergence of informal and semi-formalised collective actions in farming practices as synergistic supplements to existing formal structures and institutions through mechanisms of social learning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Grazing plays a key role in reducing the external inputs required for ruminant production and in alleviating feed-food competition. Beyond the production of meat and milk, grassland-based systems provide a wide range of ecosystem services. Agroecology and organic farming aim to reconcile natural resource management and food production, in the long term, based on the management of ecological processes. In this perspective paper, we report what we have learned from case studies with beef cattle, sheep, and dairy cattle across Uruguay and western Europe, in which we have been involved. Multicriteria methods, such as Pareto frontiers and positive deviances, were used to analyze trade-offs and identify win–wins from farm surveys. Long-term farm networks coupled with bioeconomic optimization models revealed fluctuations in farm income and allowed estimating system resilience. Extensive farmlet experiments made it possible to integrate knowledge on animal physiology and grassland ecology in the system redesign process and to test for innovative and risky management options that could lead to unacceptable learning costs in commercial farms. Finally, learning from farmers' local knowledge in teams with researchers and technical advisers can provide positive changes in grazing systems. In Uruguayan family farms, for example, the scientific knowledge gained from farmlet experiments led to advice on management options based on farm-specific diagnosis. Farmers adapted the proposals, with researchers supporting the processes by providing quantitative information on consequences and spaces for reflection. In a French cheese production area, the focus was on farmers' own experience. Games facilitated interactions as participants could challenge each other's reasoning and conclusions in a safe environment. These two case studies illustrate the diversity of co-innovation approaches, but in both cases knowledge sharing between researchers, farmers, and other stakeholders appeared more efficient to help farmers understand and adapt their own system properties than researching “best practice” solutions for large-scale transfer. © Copyright © 2020 Dumont, Modernel, Benoit, Ruggia, Soca, Dernat, Tournadre, Dogliotti and Rossing.},

They receive historical academic criticism but remain inexpensive, do not require technical skills (unlike smartphones), and bypass language/literacy barriers. Here, a comprehensive participatory pipeline is described that included 56 Nepalese women farmer editors to develop 100 picture-based lessons. Thereafter, the Theory of Planned Behavior is used as a framework to evaluate 20 diverse lessons using quantitative and qualitative data (Nvivo-11) collected from four groups, focusing on low-literacy women: the women farmer editors (n = 56); smallholder field testers who had prior exposure to extension agents and the actual innovations (control group, n = 120), and those who did not (test group, n = 60); expert stakeholders (extension agents/scientists, n = 25). The expected comprehension difference between farmer groups was non-substantive, suggesting that the participatory editing/testing approaches were effective. There were surprising findings compared to the academic literature: smallholders comprehended the pictures without the help of extension agents, perhaps because of the participatory approaches used; children assisted their mothers to understand caption-based lessons; the farmers preferred printed pictures compared to advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs); and the resource-poor farmers were willing to pay for the printed materials, sufficient to make them cost-neutral/scalable. These findings have implications for smallholder farmers beyond Nepal. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The transportation load of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) seedlings from the nursery to planting sites is a crucial problem facing the extension of smallholder plantations in Cameroon. This load can be considerably reduced by removing soil from the roots, which in turn exposes the plants to water and nutrients stresses. A greenhouse pot experiment was carried out to evaluate the recovery performance of such soil-stripped seedlings as a function of watering frequency and soil texture. Plant recovery potential was monitored on 360 nursery seedlings aged 4 months, under two soil types (sandy clay soil with 46\% fine particles and sandy loam soil with 19\% fine particles) and two watering frequencies (daily and two-days). Three monthly measurements were taken on morphological plant growth parameters including Plant height, Foliar surface, Collar diameter, Root length and Plant weight. Within and between groups analyses of variance and means separation showed the greatest variability for collar diameter, foliar surface and plant weight. All the parameters showed a greater variability and an almost-constant growth from one month to another, except for plant weight that did show a highly significant (p = 0.000) increase between the first measurement and the second. Soil type, watering and their interaction explained 97–99.5\% of the variations of all parameters. Except for root length, all other parameters were more sensitive to the effect of soil texture, explaining 83–95\% of the total variation. Only plant weight and root length showed slightly greater values under daily watering, other parameters did not show any sensibility to the two watering frequencies proposed in this experiment. Our results showed a low response of plant growth recovery on the low clay sandy loam soil, revealing that a careful selection of a soil texture is crucial for the survival of seedlings and further establishment of the plants following drought stress. It is therefore strongly recommended to many tropical countries where oil palm is an economically important crop, to take this into account during the selection of soil type for oil palm seedlings nursery. © 2020 The Authors Oil palm; Plant seedlings; Pot plant recovery; Soil-stripped seedlings; Soil texture impact; Watering impact;Agricultural soil science; Crop biomass; Soil science; Soil hydrology; Plant growth. © 2020 The Authors},

However, few empirical studies have considered how smallholders perceive climate change in Central Vietnam. This research investigates the Vietnamese smallholders’ views on the causes and indicators of climate change and factors that affect their perceptions of it in Central Vietnam. A sample size of 170 was drawn from a total of 297 smallholders and a structured questionnaire was developed to collect data. Descriptive, chi-square (χ2) and logistic regression analyses were used. The research results revealed that most smallholders perceived urbanization (93.5\%), followed by deforestation (85.3\%), air pollution (84.4\%) and unappropriated dealing with agricultural wastes (82.4\%) are the causes of climate change. A majority of smallholders perceived that excessive lightening (91.2\%), followed by change in rainfall season length (90.6\%), frequent droughts (90\%), change in temperature (88.2\%), uneven rainfall distribution (85.9\%), rainfall amount (84.1\%) and frequent floods (82.9\%) are the most noted indicators of climate change. The success of regression model overall prediction is reported by model χ2 = 92.69, p \&lt; 0.000, showing that the independent variables significantly explained the dependent variable. Among the independent variables, farming practice, information communication and technology (ICT) owned, community-based organisation participation, gender, type of household, credit programme participation and education level are significantly important determinants of smallholders’ perception on climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {A deeper understanding of how smallholder farmers perceive and manage risks is crucial to identify options that increase farmers' adaptive capacity. We investigated a broad range of risks that play a role in farmers' decision-making processes. In the cotton zone of Mali opportunities and constraints vary with the resource endowment of farms. Furthermore, as households are large in this region, often comprising 20–50 family members, intra-household diversity may influence perceptions and risk management. For this reason, we analysed diversity both among and within farms. Information was gathered through focus group discussions and a survey with 250 people from 58 households. Risk was assessed as the combination of the perceived frequency of occurrence of hazards and the impact on food availability and income. Farmers faced a diversity of risks, with hazards related to animal and personal health, and climate variability of highest concern. Resource endowment of farms was related to risk perception to a limited extent. Differences within the household were related to the generational factor and decision power, and not to gender. Household members with decision power worried most about risks. Almost a quarter of described hazards occurred with a high frequency and led to a high impact on food availability and income. Low resource-endowed farms were more often exposed to high risks than other farm types. Farmers applied a variety of actions to cope with hazards, yet in many cases farmers lacked a response. Medical actions were targeted to human and animal health hazards. Changes in field and animal management practices, adapted consumption rates and calls on social interactions, were combined for a diversity of hazards. By assessing the diversity of risks encountered by farmers and the diversity of risk management actions taken by farmers, this study goes beyond common risk research that focuses on a single hazard. Our results suggest that development interventions should not focus on either agronomic or economic options separately, but combine both to strengthen social well-being and agricultural production. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The combined and interacting effects of land-use change, resource extraction and climate change threaten the sustainability of millions of mainly smallholder farms in tropical agroforested landscapes. In many of these landscapes, coordinated action among stakeholders at landscape level would help to address challenges such as pests and diseases, price crises and climate change. However, methods to facilitate the co-production of sustainable landscape management in such complex multi-stakeholder systems are currently largely lacking. In this paper, we present a novel approach to explore pathways for the sustainability transition of agroforestry systems. By combining participatory forecasting and backcasting approaches, based on serious games and future vision development, we explore relevant agroforestry management strategies for reaching sustainable future coffee-based agroforestry landscapes. We focused our research on the challenges faced in the main coffee-producing area in Nicaragua. Here, we organized five participatory game sessions to explore farmer decision-making processes, farming strategies and to develop new networks and stimulate social learning among farmers. In the associated backcasting workshop, the most influential game session participants joined technicians, researchers and municipality officials to collectively envision sustainable future landscape management. In all game sessions, farmers developed diversified coffee-based agroforested landscapes characterised by increased density and diversity of shade trees, for the purpose of income diversification as well as forest conservation. During the backcasting workshop, the participants identified policy instruments and community-based solutions for the transition to sustainable landscapes. Our participatory approach facilitated discussion on landscape planning among farmers and other stakeholders and allowed the outline of a pathway towards the collective envisioned future landscape. The combination of participatory forecasting and backcasting proved to be a helpful tool to support multi-stakeholder processes towards sustainable landscape management in this and other complex landscapes. © 2020, The Author(s).},

In order to implement effective communication strategies in Madagascar, a better understanding must be gained of practices and perceptions related to antimicrobial use at the smallholder farm level. Our study used a semi-qualitative approach, called Q methodology, to identify patterns of opinion on antimicrobial use, or its alternatives, among pig and poultry smallholders and drug vendors in the commune of Imerintsiatosika, in Madagascar. Twenty-nine breeders and 23 drug vendors were asked to rank, respectively, 38 and 45 statements, produced from semi-structured interviews and secondary data, through a 7 grade scale from −3 (totally disagree) to +3 (totally agree) about antimicrobial use, related risks and alternatives. The interview ended with a discussion around extreme statements. The Q-sortings were analyzed by factor analysis and Principal Component Analysis. Regarding antimicrobial use, antimicrobial resistance and alternatives, the breeders and drug vendors were divided according to three discourses: “A: confidence in antibiotics” (respectively, 13 and 6 individuals), “B: belief in alternatives” (7 and 7 individuals), and “C: moderate approach to antibiotic use” (6 and 6 individuals), explaining, respectively, 57 and 60\% of total variance. Group A was associated with the use of antibiotics as a preventive measure, poor knowledge of resistance and low trust in alternatives. Group B considered the preventive use of antibiotics to be a major problem for antimicrobial resistance and believed that alternatives, such as vaccines, were useful preventive methods. Group C seemed to have a hazy opinion. The presence of three main points of view offers the possibility to adapt awareness messages. Group B might also be used as a showcase to reduce the amounts of antibiotics used by the two other groups. This study revealed different practices and risk perceptions related to antimicrobial use that must be better characterized and accurately quantified. © Copyright © 2020 Bâtie, Kassie, Randravatsilavo, Baril, Waret Szkuta and Goutard.},

	abstract = {In the western highlands of Guatemala, the indigenous population is one of the most marginalized communities. The food security of subsistence and infrasubsistence smallholders within this population still relies on domestic agricultural production as the principal livelihood activity and the main source of food. Smallholder production systems in the region are complex, with multiple interacting subsystems functioning at different integration levels and with different temporal dynamics. Previous results, based on a data set of nearly 5,000 farm households using a robust food availability indicator (that quantifies agricultural production, consumption, transformation, and commercialization of produce), have shown large differences in food security between farmers in the western highlands of Guatemala. Another important finding was that more than half of the farm households do not have the means to produce enough energy for home consumption from their agricultural activities. Identifying the constraints, patterns, and underlying processes driving food security could give rise to a set of easy-to-measure variables that quickly and reliably assess household food security status; such a tool would be helpful for decision and policy makers trying to focus on actions more likely to succeed in improving food security in the region. In this study, we developed a predictive model of food security, through the application of machine learning techniques, to identify the most important factors, and their interactions, which account for variability in food security. The resulting “artificial neural network” model performed well, explaining nearly 85\% of the variance in food security status. By applying different sensitivity analysis methods, we were able to detect highly non-linear interactions between the different factors driving food security. Land availability per person is detected as the main constraint for attaining food security. The median value of land availability per person in the region is 0.085 ha, explaining why 52\% of the farm household population does not produce enough food energy from agriculture. Many other interactions were found between crop land allocation, diversity, yields, and food security, which can help to target interventions to improve the food security status in the region. © Copyright © 2020 Barba-Escoto, van Wijk and López-Ridaura.},

	abstract = {Striga spp. is a major threat to cereal and legume production, putting the food security and economy of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa at severe risk. This is manifested in the fact that Striga spp. infestation can result in up to 90\% loss of both cereal and legume production. A consensus exists that there is yet no single measure to efficiently control Striga spp.This is mainly because of the limited fundamental knowledge of the genetics and ecology of Striga spp. and its interaction with its hosts and host root-associated microorganisms, including plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Since Striga spp. is a root parasite, it is speculated that PGPR play a key role in controlling the emergence and development of Striga spp. At the same time, PGPR may exhibit beneficial effects on growth promotion of the host to strengthen its tolerance against Striga spp. attacks, while on the other hand, it may also induce, similar to biocontrol agents, direct suicidal effects on Striga spp. Such hypothesized associations between Striga spp., crops (e.g., cereals such as sorghum and maize), and PGPR remain largely unknown, and the central question remains if PGPR play an important role in the Striga-crop pathosystem. This knowledge gap is the central impetus of this review. It will elaborate the complex and fascinating tripartite ecological system of cereals, Striga spp. and root-associated microorgamisms. In a first step, the review will provide a comprehensive summary of the pairwise interactions between Striga spp. and cereals, cereals and PGPR, as well as Striga spp. and PGPR. This summary will then merge into the discussion about the yet limited knowledge of the tripartite interaction between cereals, Striga spp., and PGPR. This specifically includes the exploration of recent discoveries related to population genetics and the life cycle of Striga spp, host (cereal) defense responses to and mechanisms of Striga spp. infestation, as well as the inhibitory and stimulatory role of PGPR on Striga spp. seed germination. In a concluding section, remaining research gaps are identified and necessary research perspectives are provided to direct prospective research toward further understanding the relationship between the three biological components paving the avenue to develop biological and environmentally friendly measures to fight off the everlasting threat of Striga spp. © CAB International 2020 (Online ISSN 1749-8848)},

	abstract = {The recent development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) encourages the use of the internet as a source of information for cocoa farmers. The farmers need innovation and technology to improve the quality of cocoa production. This study was aimed to analyze the factors influencing farmers’ internet literacy. A survey was conducted in Pidie Jaya and Southeast Aceh. Random sampling techniques were used to select 352 cocoa farmers as research respondents. The independent variables used were farmers’ age, education level, number of dependents, farming experiences and cultivated land area, while dependent variable was farmers’ internet literacy rate. The effect of independent variables to dependent variable were analyzed by regression analysis using SPSS. The results revealed that farmers had a very low rate of internet literacy. There was limited ownership of communication facilities and intensity of internet utilization, while the application of information derived from the internet for farming was very low. Education level was found to have a positive and significant effect on farmers’ internet literacy rate, whereas the age of farmer and farming experiences showed a significantly negative effect. Farmers were lack of ability to select and apply information obtained from the internet independently, hence interpersonal communication with extension agents was still prominent for the farmers. The effort to increase farmers’ internet literacy can be done through strengthening farmers ability in ut ilizing internet through extension services and institutional support. © 2020 SERSC.},

	abstract = {Communicating weather and climate information for farm decision-making remains a challenge for hydro-meteorological agencies, including the Philippine agency DOST-PAGASA. Through stakeholder engagements with smallholder farmers in Calapan, Oriental Mindoro, three possible root causes were identified: a lack of awareness and accessibility to information, the misinterpretation of probabilistic seasonal forecast and drought categories, and an inadequate understanding of local climate change implications. In this paper, we describe a series of steps to address these barriers. To improve awareness of information we implemented simplified scientific climate knowledge presented through a KlimAgrikultura workshop and conducted crop risk matching to identify relevant climate products. The understanding of seasonal climate forecasts was addressed by simplified tools to analyze seasonal impacts of ENSO on rainfall which helped end-users visualize and examine the relevance of monthly forecasts relative to the baseline historical rainfall distribution for each ENSO phase. The complex issue of climate change was addressed through localized historical and projected climate information which provided Calapan rice farmers with foresight on future threats of drought and extreme rainfall. We conclude by reflecting on advice from the World Meteorological Organization on effective Climate Services, and how the work described in this paper meets these recommendations. © 2020, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

	abstract = {This article explores ex ante the impact pathways of a hypothetical intervention which consists in providing smallholder farmers with weather-related information. It uses a qualitative approach based on focus group discussions in three villages with smallholder farmers and agricultural extension officers to build a theory of change. Results suggest that providing smallholder farmers with weather-related information has the potential to help them in taking informed production decisions. In doing so, smallholder farmers can better allocate their production resources and eventually record higher yield and income. The ultimate impact is that smallholder farmers will have better lives (i.e. livelihoods). There are several types of weather-related information that can be useful for farmers. There are also several dissemination channels. Some are based on local social networks and others on information and communication technologies. Each channel has strengths and weaknesses and the best or optimal dissemination approach would probably depend on the setting of the intervention area. A number of assumptions need to be in place for an impactful intervention. For instance, weather-related information needs to be accurate, available in a timely manner and easy to use. The described possible impact pathways need to be tested rigorously through policy-oriented research. © Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa, 2021.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the current tomato seed value chain for Uganda. Survey responses determined roles of key participants, including Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) for regulation and certification; National Agricultural Research Organization for breeding cultivars and seed multiplication; Makerere University for education and research; commercial seed companies for seed importation and conditioning; seed distributors for sales; and smallholder farmers as savers and end users of seed. Challenges included an inefficient domestic seed distribution system, technical constraints in seed production and conditioning by seed companies, inadequate networks and communication among the seed industry’s key participants, and partial regulation of the seed industry. Seed companies played a key role in seed conditioning processes. Companies imported all tomato seeds into Uganda and stated germination as their primary goal for quality. Challenges for seed companies included assistance from MAAIF to regulate and certify seed and access to improved technologies. Attaining high quality seed by commercial Uganda-parent companies will require additional investment and training of seed technologists for domestic testing and seed quality assurance. © 2020.

	abstract = {Micro-insurance can be an effective approach to smoothening income in adverse times and potentially a way to contribute to the financial inclusion of vulnerable populations. However, direct sales to individual smallholders remains a challenging task without an easily scalable solution. The current research seeks to find the determinants of adoption of a stand-alone coffee index-based insurance product in Uganda marketed by a farmer cooperative, and elicited preferences for improving the design and delivery model. A stratified household survey was conducted among 614 farmers, of which 40\% adopted insurance and 62\% were member of a farmer cooperative. In odds ratio terms, adopters perceived themselves to be 3.09 times more likely to receive a pay-out than non-adopters (P{\textless}0.01), and those having better access to extension services were 2.47 times more likely to adopt a policy (P{\textless}0.01). Yet farmers perceiving the design as complex were approximately half as likely to adopt (P{\textless}0.05). Farmers preferred the option of premium payments proceeds on delivery, mobile premium payments and deliver-ing insurance through cooperatives/associations. Deepening insurance uptake among coffee farmers will therefore require a strong focus on communication and information sharing facilitated by cooperatives/associations (e.g. farmer cooperates, village and saving associations, or women’s associations). © 2020, NAIK Research Institute of Agricultural Economics.

An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80\%) and high gains (50.20\%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers’ improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Providing smallholder farmers with support through conventional government extension approaches is challenging as the number of extension agents is decreasing. At the same time, new information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as short message services (SMS) sent via mobile phones, show considerable promise to complement existing extension services. In the UP-scaling Technology in Agriculture through Knowledge and Extension (UPTAKE) Project, ICTs were used to create awareness and increase uptake and adoption of agricultural innovations by maize farmers in Tanzania. Two SMS-based maize campaigns were implemented during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 cropping seasons in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Prior to the start of the campaigns, formative research to determine maize production knowledge, practices and challenges was conducted in Mbeya and Songwe Region. After the campaign a telephone survey, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted. During the campaign, about 3.8 million SMS were disseminated to over 55,000 farmers. 73\% were male, 19\% owned smart phones and 86\% farmed maize on up to 1.2 hectares of land. Farmers reported maize production challenges as: unreliable markets, inadequate extension services, pest outbreaks and lack of knowledge to identify counterfeit inputs particularly seeds and fertilizers. The UPTAKE mobile SMS campaign was a new approach to agricultural extension in this area. A telephone survey amongst a sample of farmers who received the SMS revealed that 53\% of respondents considered that this was now their preferred as a source of information compared to traditional sources including neighbours and family members, demonstration plots, agricultural extension workers and radios. Key lessons learnt relate to management of databases of farmer contacts, importance of participatory processes in developing content and designing SMS campaigns, and the need for flexibility and promptness in responding to emerging threats such as delayed rains and outbreaks of pests. Good practices like buy in and authorizations from the government administrative structures and compliance with country’s regulations on communication are integral to the success of ICT projects. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In recent years, agricultural extension services in developing countries have increasingly introduced modern information and communication technologies (ICT)to deliver advice. But to realize efficiency gains, digital applications may need to address heterogeneous information needs by targeting agricultural advisory contents in a household-specific way. We explore the feasibility of an automated advisory service that collects household data from farmers, for example through the keypads of conventional mobile phones, and uses this data to prioritize agricultural advisory messages accordingly. To reduce attrition, such a system must avoid lengthy inquiry. Therefore, our objective was to identify a viable trade-off between low data requirements and useful household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages. At three sites in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania independently, we collected experimental preference rankings from smallholder farmers for receiving information about different agricultural and livelihood practices. At each site, we identified socio-economic household variables that improved model-based predictions of individual farmers’ information preferences. We used the models to predict household-specific rankings of information options based on 2–4 variables, requiring the farmer to answer between 5 and 10 questions through an ICT interface. These predicted rankings could inform household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages in a digital agro-advisory application. Household-specific “top 3” options suggested by the models were better-fit to farmers’ preferences than a random selection of 3 options by 48–68\%, on average. The analysis shows that relatively limited data inputs from farmers, in a simple format, can be used to increase the client-orientation of ICT-mediated agricultural extension. This suggests that household-specific prioritization of agricultural advisory messages through digital two-way communication is feasible. In future digital agricultural advisory applications, collecting little data from farmers at each interaction may feed into learning algorithms that continuously improve the targeting of advice. © 2019 The Authors},

A longitudinal study involving six focus group discussions and 100 semi-structured interviews were conducted in August 2015 to February 2016, and later 21 key informant interviews in June 2018 to generate data from farmers and local extension staff. While thematic-content analysis was used for the qualitative data, SPSS v.18 was used for quantitative data analysis.Our findings indicate that changes in rice production practices and technologies were mainly influenced by a combination of factors including technological advancement, farmer ambitions, power dynamics, edaphic and climate variations, access to extension advisory services, use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as video and information sharing among farmers. Informants approved the use of video as an important extension service delivery tool in equipping farmers with the necessary knowledge and skills that are key in influencing change in rice production practices and technologies. Video also triggers discussions among participants during and after the show through various knowledge sharing mechanisms with serious implications on change in production practices and technologies. As policy and decision makers attempt to reform extension delivery mechanisms, there is need to acknowledge that video alone cannot produce a desirable change in production practices and technologies among farmers but play a complementary role to other extension approaches in efforts to effectively disseminate relevant information. © 2019 Ecological Society of India .

	abstract = {The ongoing expansion of global trade and human mobility are causing increased occurrences of biosecurity outbreaks, particularly of invasive pests which threaten biodiversity and agricultural production. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable, as they are generally not well-prepared for such incursions. In Australia, farmers with non-English speaking backgrounds are more likely to be influenced by these increasing risks and may need long-term adaptive support. Understanding farmers’ perceptions of biosecurity threats, and what drives these perceptions, is a prerequisite for designing effective biosecurity management policies to support livelihoods and food security. In this study, we aim to understand the perceptions of smallholder farmers’ on biosecurity threats and the factors influencing their perceptions. Data was obtained from a survey of 101 Vietnamese farmers across three geographically dispersed locations in Australia (Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia). Using the Protection Motivation Theory, we found that 43\% of farmers perceived biosecurity threats to be one of the key agricultural risks, preceded by weather-related risk (48\%) and produce price fluctuations (45\%). Belief in the existence of biosecurity threats and the sources of information on biosecurity matters had a significant positive influence on farmers’ overall perceptions of biosecurity threats on four dimensions of their life. English levels had a significant influence on their perceptions of biosecurity threats on crop output whereas farm size, gender, and farmers’ age did not significantly affect farmers’ overall perceptions of biosecurity threats. The findings of this study could be used by government agencies and industry associations to better target support for farmers to minimise the threats of pest and disease incursions. Support could be delivered through the introduction of relevant extension services and education programs with more transparent and direct communications of risk and compliances, improving farmers’ knowledge and belief in biosecurity and fostering trust between farmers and the government. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The major constraints faced by both farmers and agricultural extensionists are lack of awareness about ITES, cost of technology and lack of skill in using the ITES. These constraints still remain as the major hindrances in using various ITES.

	abstract = {The changing climate is adversely affecting the productivity and livelihoods of Nigerian smallholder rural farmers. Several studies predict worsening outcomes for future climate events, for example heat waves, drought and intense precipitation. Farmers are required to adopt several measures to thrive, given the observed or expected climate change events. Existing studies about the interaction between climate change the agriculture sector has focused evaluating the bi-directional causal relationships, and identifying adaptation measures, but research on the climate resilience aspect of these adaptation measures is missing, or at best, low. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by assessing resilience and contribution to sustainability of farmer-adopted measures aimed at addressing risks posed by climate change. We conduct a systematic review of 95 studies concentrating on climate adaptation by smallholder rural farmers in Nigeria in the period 2010 to 2019. We assess the climate resilience of adaptation measures using the Ifejika-Speranza Resilience Check Toolkit. Our findings show that farmers are using climate-resilient adaptation measures; however, we could not ascertain how these have led to sustainable agricultural systems, since it is not the focus of the current study. Our findings show that majority of the adaptation studies in Nigeria are focused on crop farming subsystem. The major agricultural ecosystems and the broad adaptation areas are: Crop farming (improved soil and land management, crop-specific Innovation, water management practices, climate information services and education, access to finance, and off-farm diversification), livestock farming (improved livestock management systems, improved breeding strategies, sustainable health improvement, proper feed formulation early maturing and heat-resistant bird varieties), and fish farming (water harvesting measures, organic material, quick-maturing varieties). © 2019 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

However, application of ICT in knowledge management in Ethiopia is low when compared with several African countries. Various factors are determining ICT usage in agriculture by smallholder farmers. Hence, the study was carried out to identify the factors determining ICT usage in agriculture by smallholder farmers in the Tiyo District, Arsi Zone. Sample magnitude was resolute using the formula provided by Yamane. From the selected three kebeles, 146 smallholder farmers were selected using stratified random sampling technique. Quantitative data was collected through survey using semi-structured interview schedule. Qualitative data was collected through focus group discussion, key informant interview and observation. It was found through inferential statistic tests that the factors namely, family size, distance to mobile service centre, land size, economic motivation, cosmo politeness were having non-significant relationship with ICT usage. Access to personal credit and ICT facility in FTC were constant. There was no access to personal credit for all respondents and absence of ICT facility in FTC for respondents in general. Therefore, these above-mentioned factors were not included in the model. Binary logistic regression analysis indicates that total annual income, possession of radio and television shows positive significant relationship whereas age shows negative relationship with ICT usage. Hence, the Ethiopian public extension system should concentrate more on designing radio and television programs for the transfer of technology. The government owned television channels also allocate more time for agricultural programs on fixed timings convenient to the farmers. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

	abstract = {The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus is one of the most important ectoparasites of cattle. Traditionally, the control measure for this kind of tick is mainly with synthetic chemicals, which are expensive, toxic to the environment and applicators, and they require skills to administer. Indigenous knowledge (IKs) are eco-friendly and best alternative interventions to sustain and improve livestock productivity in resource-challenged smallholder farming areas. Hence, the study aimed at assessing the potential acaricidal properties of the Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in combination with laundry soap (UfreshTM tablet) formulation against Rhipicephalus appendiculatus larvae and ticks. The in vitro study was carried at the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Lilongwe, Central Region of Malawi from November 2016 to February 2017. The ticks and the larvae were exposed to five concentrations (0.04ml/ml, 0.05ml/ ml, 0.1ml/ml, 0.2ml/ml and 0.13g/ml) of seven different prepared solutions (Tobacco-water extract, Tobacco-ethanol extract, Soap, Soap tobacco-water extract, Soap tobacco-ethanol extract, Ashtraz 12.5\% (Amitraz Group) and Cyba-Dip, 15\% (Cypermethrine) using the Adult Immersion Test (AIT) and laying ability tests. Results from the in-vitro study showed that all the tobacco remains extract concentrations including the control chemicals induced mortality and anti-laying ability in line with the increased concentration levels of the exposed solution, (P{\textless}0.05). Tobacco-water extracts, tobacco ethanol extracts and the two control solutions (Amitraz and Cyba-dip) recorded the lowest LC50 in all the tests conducted. The average LC50 concentration on mortality test was observed at 0.11ml/ml while in laying ability test it was recorded at 0.062ml/ml. However, the study showed a negative interaction of soap when used in combination with these extracts. In conclusion, the study opens a potential avenue in dealing with ticks. Making it possible to make a simple, effective, inexpensive and eco-friendly acaricidal that eliminates the need for the commercial acaricides, which are expensive. © 2019 Livestock Research for Rural Development.

	abstract = {In Brazil, the protagonists of the agroecological model advocate a shift from a diffusionist and top-down vision to participatory approaches which value farmers' knowledge. This shift raises the issue of the link between ways of learning and the agroecological transition processes of farmers. This article is based on a survey of 31 family farmers carried out in the Brazilian state of Paraná. The role of farmer's "ecolearning" processes, i.e., learning processes based on their interactions with the environment and the non-human beings involved in their farming activities, in agroecological transition processes is assessed, in relation to more classical "hetero-learning" processes (based on interactions with others). Our analysis shows that ecolearning processes foster robust ecologisation processes. Indeed, they reinforce farmers' systemic visions of their activities. They strengthen the sensitive dimension of these systemic visions alongside its more cognitive dimension. The strengthening of these systemic visions over time reduces the risks of backing down in terms of technical practices or farming choices, thus making agroecological transitions more robust. © NSS-Dialogues, EDP Sciences 2019.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the backbone of many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, lack of efficient extension systems to support agricultural development is widely seen as a missing link in agricultural transformation in the region. International development agencies have in the past four decades invested heavily in various extension models such as the Training and Visit and Farmer Field School systems in order to enhance the performance of extension workers. Despite such investments, the performance of extension agents does remain suboptimal in many contexts. Studies in other sectors show that incentivizing worker performance through nudges such as incentive realignment schemes that tie worker performance to a pay/bonus system could enhance worker productivity. However, there is a lack of incentive realignment studies that estimate the performance of extension agents in sub-Saharan Africa. A potential hindrance to the application of such scheme to extension is the absence of monitoring mechanisms to track the performance of extension agents who often work across diverse local contexts to reach smallholder farmers with extension advice. This study empirically estimates the effect of an information communication technology (ICT)-based payment incentive system that tracks the performance of extension workers in rural Uganda. It undertakes a quasi-experimental ex-post impact assessment of a payment incentive realignment as an exogenous shift in the price of labor for extension services by Ugandan Community Knowledge Workers (CKWs) in 2011. This study applies a difference-in-difference with propensity score matching technique to estimate the effect of an ICT-based incentive re-alignment scheme in 2011, on the performance of 461 CKWs in rural Uganda. The study shows that CKWs in rural Uganda respond positively to an ICT-based performance incentive scheme that affects the price of labor. Results suggest that such performance systems can enhance the productivity of CKWs - an exemplar of rural extension agents in Uganda and elsewhere in developing countries. It also finds that younger CKWs respond more productively to higher incentives than their older counterparts. Therefore, the study suggests that extension policies that tie extension agents' performance to ICT-based payment incentives could enhance their performance and contribute towards the sustainable developments goals on food security, among others, through multiplier effects. © Afr.

	abstract = {The effectiveness of an extension system referred to its ability to meet the farmer needs in providing the new technology which suits to their conditions and results in better production. Recently the demand for information on agricultural practices and technology among the farmers is increasing day by day but fulfilment of these demands exclusively by public agricultural extension system is limited. To address this challenge, information communication technology (ICT) has the immense role in supplementing the extension system. Among the ICT tools, mobile phone, because of its affordability, accessibility, minimum skill requirement, widespread network etc., has emerged as important tool for information and knowledge dissemination to the smallholder and marginal farmers. But it is necessary to study how effective they are in achieving the respective objectives.The present investigation was conducted to study the effectiveness of mKRISHI ® PAWS (Personalised Advisory on Water and Soil) in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand state. An ex-post facto research design was used for this study. Total 136 messages were sent to the respondents. The data was collected from 240 beneficiary farmers of the north-western Himalayan region. The effectiveness of the mKRISHI® PAWS in technology advisory and delivery services were measured by developing an effectiveness index for the purpose. Results showed that 93.8\% of farmers perceive that quality of information regarding the latest NRM technologies in soil and water conservation was excellent and 83.75\% of the farmers felt that the information regarding the latest NRM technologies in soil and water conservation was appropriate to their condition. The study revealed that the extension services delivered by mKRISHI ® PAWS were found to be highly effective by majority of the farmers. 34.58\% farmers perceived that the mKRISHI ® PAWS was very highly effective as a mean of getting their information needs. © 2019 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

The subject is developed from bibliographical and documental research (Brazilian legislations), besides testimonies from Brazilian researchers who have worked together with family farmers, smallholders, settlers, and recyclable material collectors that are organised in cooperatives and associations. Our analyses are structured in dialogue with the hypothesis of dysfunctionality of the university. A review of higher education and science and technology policies is carried out and considered in regard to inclusion and the relationship with the popular classes. Our focus is on the first decade of the twenty-first century, a brief period of neo-developmentalism that ended with the deepening of the current counter-reforms. Initially, it is analyzed the higher education. Then, it is discussed the trends in Science and Technology policy. This is followed by analyzes of the relationship between university and popular classes, an alternative that is carried out contradictorily. It is concluded that the University recreates itself by contributing to popular classes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

This study provides valuable insights into the conditions that can promote farmers’ acceptance of regulated deficit irrigation and a new water pricing policy to address CC impacts on the semi-arid irrigated region which will allow for a sustainable irrigation regime and the conservation of water resources at regional scale. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze data collected from 100 farmers in the citrus regions of Beni Khalled and Menzel Bouzelfa, to identify determining factors for farmers’ willingness to accept the proposed water management strategies. Empirical findings reveal that the significant explanatory variables are essentially linked to farmer satisfaction about the current irrigation management in relation to water supply reliability, rather than the social criteria and farmers’ awareness of water scarcity. More efforts are needed to improve the transparency of water allocation systems to motivate the willingness of water users to adopt new technologies or policies. The different stakeholders should agree to take action now about strategic extension and communication plans to enhance awareness on ensuing environmental problems, to take advantage of long-term profitability of the water restriction. © IWA Publishing 2018.},

One approach hereby is to use multi-stakeholder innovation systems, such as the ‘Nicaraguan Learning Al-liance’ (NLA). However, tools for the evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems are rare. This paper reports on the implementation of a conceptual framework to carry out an impact evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems using the NLA as the object of study. The assessment focused on the business relationship constructs of trust and capacity development. Survey interviews, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions collected data from agribusiness stakeholders linked with the NLA and from a control group of stakeholders involved with other networks. The quantitative data were analysed through factor and regression analyses. Results from the quantitative analyses were triangulated with qualitative data. The analysis shows that the NLA has been successful in developing smallholder farmers’ capacities as a result of trust developed through its dedicated project managers. Nonetheless, the NLA has not been more successful at developing agribusiness capacities among Nicaraguan farmers than other networks with the same goals. Results from this study point to the need for facilitating more interactions between the different networks of farmers’ cooperatives and organisations with other stakeholders already active within the Nicaraguan agrifood innovation system. © 2018, Kassel University Press GmbH.

This study highlights the importance of the sociocultural context for determining the success or otherwise of high-level programs at a local, rural level. The paper draws on data from individual interviews with 15 successful progressive farmers in the three rural districts of eastern Uganda that have benefited from the donor aid-driven NAADS program. Preliminary analysis of this data has identified interacting economic, political, geographic, and sociocultural factors at work in the implementation of this program. Determining 'what did and did not work' for the progressive farmers is useful not only to policy makers, but also to other smallholder farmers still entrenched in poverty and wanting to access the NAADS program. © 2016 School of Social Work.

	abstract = {Background: Plant genotypes are rarely developed for mixed cropping systems despite the potential of these systems to provide multiple ecosystem services. One of the most ubiquitously grown mixed cropping systems is a common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) intercrop, but there is little consensus among researchers, and few known studies document farmer knowledge, about superior bean genotypes specifically for this intercrop system. Participatory plant breeding (PPB) is a well-accepted method of selecting varieties with farmers and could be a useful tool for identifying genotypes for intercrops. We used sole crop and intercrop PPB on-farm trials (n = 13) and interviews (n = 59) to document farmer knowledge about climbing bean genotypes and adaptation for intercrops in Rwanda, where smallholder farmers have traditionally grown beans and maize for generations. Results: Qualitative analysis demonstrated that farmers considered distinct attributes for different cropping systems. In intercrops, farmer evaluation prioritized five factors: universal traits and trait-based competitive ability, intrinsic competitive ability, environmental adaptation, and management. Farmers consider intrinsic competitive ability crucial, whereas most other studies have neglected this attribute in intercrop breeding strategies. Furthermore, farmers identified specific attributes that constitute an intercrop bean ideotype: adaptation, restricted height, columnar plant structure, even distribution of pods, fewer leaves, and earlier maturity. Farmers also had specific techniques for testing cropping system and environment interactions. Conclusions: PPB on-farm trial evaluations and interviews with farmers allowed us to combine traditional agroecological knowledge with plant breeding research to generate new knowledge that contributes to our understanding of intercrop breeding and bean traits for intercrops. Farmers demonstrated sophisticated understanding of methods to identify genotype adaptation, competitive ability, and specific traits that together create a bean ideotype for maize-bean cropping systems. Empowering farmers through on-farm testing of diverse genotypes, and even populations, could be a practical solution to expensive genotype by environment trials and improve the identification of highly adaptive and productive genotypes for diverse and resilient cropping systems. © 2016 The Author(s).},

The results showed that 40\% of surveyed farmers are between 41 and 50 years old and 24\% are older than 60, most of them do not have the complete primary school (68\%) and the gross monthly income level of 64\% of households is up to two minimum wages per month. The main source of income presented was the partial renting; however, the resulting incomes from off-farm labor and from retirement/pensions are also important. Thus, it is concluded that these characteristics outlined serve as a warning to local extension, for promoting highly dependent - labor knowledge or more complex skills that present a high risk of rejection or failure. Thus, the most assertive way forward for the extension is from this economic reality to establish a dialogue with settled families.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Purpose: Approaches to build farmers' analytical capacities are said to trigger wide-ranging changes. This article reports on the communication process between participants and non-participants in one such approach, related to the technical and management skills learned by participants and the changes these participants subsequently made, and the outcomes in terms of non-participants' learning. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this study, we analysed the following: (1) participants' learning and changes in social practices; (2) communication between participants and non-participants regarding technical and management skills and changes in social practices; (3) non-participants' learning and changes in social practices. The case study was a management advice to family farm project in three villages in Benin. Findings: Most participants learned management skills, which led them to reassess their objectives and to reduce traditional social practices they now considered unproductive. Even in the case of frequent communication, non-participants found it difficult to learn management skills, which hindered their experiential learning. Non-participants consequently had difficulty understanding why participants changed their social practices such as reduction of their traditional gift giving, leading to limited well-argued discussion about these changes in practices between participants and non-participants. Practical Implications: This study shows that, due to the limited learning process of non-participants communicating with participants, there is a need to design and test approaches to achieve capacity-building while including more participants at a similar cost, and to stimulate explicit discussion at village level about the changes in values and social practices that these approaches may trigger. Originality/Value: The article analyses both participants and non-participants' experiential learning, and looks at the two sides of the interaction between the communication processes and non-participants' learning. © 2014 Wageningen University.},

	abstract = {Gravatai is a municipality within the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, with great potential for agricultural development based on greater interaction between producers and research and extension services. The main objectives of this study were to understand local perceptions and knowledge about the natural resources of soils and landscapes, as well as the logic of production systems; and to evaluate the linkage of this knowledge with soil classification and evaluation made through academic criteria. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in the five production units (PU) studied, conducting a survey of data related to the PU and workers families, a walk across the PU, and a rapid survey of the soil with the participation of producers and family members. Field observations from family farmers were related to morphological descriptions and the analytic results obtained from soil profile sampling. Results obtained showed that there is systematization of farmers’ knowledge concerning soil and other natural resources, allowing geographic soil distribution, relation to the environment, and criteria for use and management to be established. Results obtained also showed a clear relationship between local and academic knowledge, constituting potential for planning and consolidation of sustainable production systems. © 2015, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

All phones were equipped with a special data SIM card, normally used in USB sticks for mobile broadband. This kind of SIM card only allows outgoing data connections, thereby effectively preventing misuse of credit by enumerators for calls or SMS messages. An alternative approach is Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing, a similar methodology that uses laptops, netbooks or tablets as an interface during the interview process. With relatively highly trained enumerators this allows for even the most complicated and in-depth (multi-hour) household surveys to be administered with a maximum amount of support for the enumerator.},

	abstract = {Autochthonous agroforestry systems have mainly evolved in former natural forest areas or tree-rich vegetation formations, such as woodlands. In such agroecosystems a high degree of diversity of indigenous tree species (α-diversity) must be expected. Knowledge about the contribution of agroforestry land-use to the in-situ conservation of biotic diversity is scarce. This case study on the diversity of indigenous woody perennials in tree-based land-use forms of the Bukusu agroforestry system in Western Kenya is exemplary for East African smallholder farming systems. Those vegetation formations of medium to low human disturbance intensity and linked with autochthonous land-use strategies are rich in floristic make-up, speaking for a high conservation value. As regards floristic diversity at a landscape scale, the frequency and constancy of divese vegetation formations and tree-rich land management units are crucial for successful preservation of a high α-diversity of woody species. Botanical data are being related to findings obtained from retrospective land-use analysis. The results show clearly how spatial and functional heterogeneity of the land-use system does not simply portray ecological aspects. Rather, the cultural landscape diversity pattern reflects agrarian development and socio-economic circumstances from a historical perspective. The vegetation cover is being moulded by culture-specific decisions of the Bukusu people living and acting within the area studied. The species composition of complex vegetation structures, as the mosaic-like distribution of these functional units, are the result of interactions between naturally and culturally related factors. Interestingly enough, the most structurally diverse land-use forms with high α-diversity values for woody species appear in areas with high population densities and a decrease in farm size, provided agricultural intensification followed progressive diversification of traditional land-use by taking up autochthonous components. The structural order of the anthropogenetically differentiated vegetation cover reflects complex interactions of a set of complementary functions and interrelated land-use strategies of agroecological, socio-cultural and economic kinds of factor. The flexibility of the eminently differentiated land-use system is on the basis of biological and economic buffer capacities due to tree species richness, in turn facilitating integral and dynamic functioning of the land use system in its entirety.},

It is divided into six sections: (1) rethinking extension, (2) the relationships between human practice, knowledge and communication, (3) innovation as a process of network building, social learning and negotiation, (4) media, methods and process management, (5) organizational and interorganizational issues, and (6) epilogue. Section 1 (chapters 1-4) discusses the challenges for agricultural extension practice, the historical roots and changing conceptions of extension, different types of communication services and strategies, agricultural knowledge systems, the ethics and politics of communication for innovation, and the role of communicative intervention in policy planning. Section 2 (chapters 5-7) covers the different levels and domains of farming practice, the social nature of technical practice, implications for communication for innovation, knowledge and perception, and communication and the construction of meaning. Section 3 (chapters 8-11) deals with the changing perspectives on innovation, social and individual learning, the negotiation within interactive processes, and the role of outsiders and different intervention approaches. Section 4 (chapters 12-15) discusses the potential of basic communication forms and media, communication for innovation methods, the management of innovation processes, and the planning of individual activities. Section 5 (chapters 16-19) covers organizational management, learning and research, agricultural knowledge and information systems, privatization and the emergence of 'knowledge markets', and cooperation cross scientific disciplines and epistemic communities.

Several chapters take the agricultural information system as their point of departure, including discussions upon the targetting of the system on resource-poor farmers, and other special categories at the macro and micro scales. Another important aspect is the formation of active utiliser constituencies in the system, and the state of the art in this respect is outlined. The final chapter deals with the agricultural information system as a tool for analysis and design of agricultural research, extension, and agricultural knowledge utilisation and examines the concepts of some advanced systems and asks how far extension science has come in using the information systems perspective. The strategic use of agricultural information systems as an instrument for achieving policy goals is emphasised. -from Author},

	abstract = {Despite a significant growth in food production over the past half-century, one of the most important challenges facing society today is how to feed an expected population of some nine billion by the middle of the 20th century. To meet the expected demand for food without significant increases in prices, it has been estimated that we need to produce 70-100 per cent more food, in light of the growing impacts of climate change, concerns over energy security, regional dietary shifts and the Millennium Development target of halving world poverty and hunger by 2015. The goal for the agricultural sector is no longer simply to maximize productivity, but to optimize across a far more complex landscape of production, rural development, environmental, social justice and food consumption outcomes. However, there remain significant challenges to developing national and international policies that support the wide emergence of more sustainable forms of land use and efficient agricultural production. The lack of information flow between scientists, practitioners and policy makers is known to exacerbate the difficulties, despite increased emphasis upon evidence-based policy. In this paper, we seek to improve dialogue and understanding between agricultural research and policy by identifying the 100 most important questions for global agriculture. These have been compiled using a horizon-scanning approach with leading experts and representatives of major agricultural organizations worldwide. The aim is to use sound scientific evidence to inform decision making and guide policy makers in the future direction of agricultural research priorities and policy support. If addressed, we anticipate that these questions will have a significant impact on global agricultural practices worldwide, while improving the synergy between agricultural policy, practice and research.

In fact, unlike countries, cities and regions compete, in single currency areas, on the basis of an absolute advantage principle and not a comparative advantage principle. This means that no efficient, automatic mechanism—like currency devaluation or prompt flexibility of wages and prices—exists to grant each territory some role in the international division of labour, whatever its relative performance. The competitiveness of territories thus emerges as a central issue, in order to secure employment stability, benefits from external integration, continuing growth of local well-being and wealth.

	abstract = {– Competition is of interest to both policy makers and managers. However, existing studies concentrate on the measurement of national competitiveness while neglecting firm competitiveness. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by developing a comprehensive and generic measurement model to understand firm competitiveness. The model is used to develop an award system to help companies in the self‐assessment of their competitiveness., – The theoretical base of the measurement of firm level competitiveness is driven from two national competitiveness models, namely World Competitive Yearbook and Global Competitiveness Index, while the assessment structure is based on the well‐known European Foundation for Quality Management Excellence Award. The competitiveness model developed in this paper is put into use in Turkey. The measures of the model are used for assessing the competitiveness of ten firms, in order to choose the most competitive firm of the year. The study in Turkey explains how the measurement model works by illustrating an example., – This paper attempts to develop a generic model in which the competition parameters do not change for individual companies. The model covers a wide variety of parameters that form the base of competition at the firm level. It is demonstrated that the competition model developed in the paper works in practice., – This paper contributes to the national competitiveness by providing deeper understanding of the dynamics of firm‐level competitiveness and provides some implications and suggestions for further studies.},

	abstract = {– The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of one of the more widespread techniques for personnel development and training: coaching. This technique in the business context entails boosting of a manager's capabilities so as to improve business results through a combination of experience, knowledge, support and the motivation provided by advisers who specialize in business management., – To analyze the effectiveness of this innovative technique, the authors examined a sample of 40 small companies located in Ceuta (an autonomous Spanish city in North Africa) using a Wilcoxon‐Mann‐Whitney test. Participants were divided into two groups; in one group, an individualized audit process was conducted to obtain an actual picture of managerial practices (focusing on needs and corrective measures). In the other group, an advising process also complemented a coaching phase that was implemented to facilitate employee adoption of the proposed measures. Ultimately, differences between these two groups were found., – Results indicate that coaching substantially increases the level to which processes of improvement are established within organizations, consequently increasing the competitive capability., – The findings highlight the potential benefits of the use of coaching in the business context. Coaching facilitates the implementation of a set of improvement measures designed to increase business competitiveness, suggesting that this type of advising stands to be very beneficial for companies., – Practices that lead to the development of human capital in organizations are basic tools for managers that are becoming increasingly essential for achieving business efficiency and strategic change. The paper analyzes the implementation of coaching in the business arena, specifically in the case of managers, which is a novelty given the dearth of empirical research on coaching. Thus, the results of the paper provide the wider academic community with empirical evidence on how coaching is a profitable practice for improving human resource management.},

	issn = {1059-5422},
	doi = {10.1108/10595421211229673},
	abstract = {– Twenty years ago, Senge's, 1990 pioneering article, ”The learning organization,” published in MIT's Sloan Management Review, received center‐stage attention. The concept received much support and was followed with articles by prominent writers and educators, Margaret Wheatley amongst them. Only ten years later, however, another prominent writer and educator, David Garvin, remarked, “Learning organizations have been embraced in theory but are still surprisingly rare.” The purpose of this paper is to argue and present support for a perspective that learning organizations have existed for over 100 years. Linking this concept to the past versus arguing that learning organizations are new will better pave the way for learning organizations to achieve a status of being more than simply “embraced in theory.”, – Three objectives were presented. The first developed an historical link, with the goal of showing that learning organizations have had a rich history and did not simply appear in 1990. The approach to the second was based on drawing implications from literature about the learning process. The very heart of competitiveness depends on how firm members experience the learning process. The process is a function of the use of tools (T) within a learning climate (C) and their interaction (T x C). The approach to the third objective was to conceptualize learning climate dimensions, old compared to new learning organizations., – First, the idea that learning is always a competitiveness issue has not been consistently advanced in the literature, if hardly at all. Second, the internal learning climates within firms are what is at the heart of other cultures' successes. Much time has been spent studying the tools used in these firms, for instance quality circles, but little time with the climate learning dimension. The climate dimension has been the reason for their success., – The paper presents a tools/climate learning dimensions matrix (a 2x2 matrix) and develops the understanding that all learning stems from two learning dimensions, tools, and the learning dimension, climate, within which the tools are employed. Within this discussion, the authors present the idea of the competitive advantage of cultures; this advantage appearing in a firm as a consequence of the “climate learning dimension” of various cultures. The concluding section of the paper presents five climate dimensions; those of yesterday compared with those of today. These well known management perspectives (e.g. single loop learning/double loop learning, independence/interdependence) are linked to the learning process with a special focus on the climate dimension of the process. It is there that the degree of the firm's competitiveness is enhanced.},

In order to be competitive, firms are implementing new technologies such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), ERP II, and radio frequency identification to reduce the cost of doing business by improving operational efficiencies, establish better relationship with their business partners, as well as effectiveness by quickly responding to changes in the marketplace. Challenges and benefits of implementing these technologies by both manufacturing and service organizations are explored and examined in this paper., – Low‐cost and differentiation strategies require corporations to integrate information and communications technologies to streamline processes both within the firm and between business associates. A considerable amount of time and capital is required for acquisition and implementation of the new technology but the return on the investment is significant in the long run. Top management participation, change in management, and employee training are critical success factors in successful utilization of technology., – The paper provides useful information with regards to the importance of technology in sustaining or gaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace.},

Use of technological and human resource management practices is examined in relation to the firms' success in achieving competitiveness. The results suggest that 80\% of these managers perceive revolutionary rather than gradual and evolutionary changes in the marketplace. They also felt that their firms are more competitive on quality and delivery goals and less competitive in cost and flexibility goals. Finally, the results suggest that technological management programs are less influential in assisting firms' achievement of their competitiveness goals than human resource management programs. ? 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

With few exceptions, those who use the term have a crude, essentially mercantilist view of world trade, in which competition among nations is just like competition between corporations. Not only do the authors and readers of reports on national competitiveness usually not understand comparative advantage, they are unaware of the most basic adding-up constraints. Economists, however, find it hard to believe that seemingly well-informed people can really be this naive, and assume that there must be more sophisticated ideas lying behind what they say. The rationales offered by economists, in turn, offer false comfort to the would-be sophisticates who like the term "competitiveness"; they believe that they have transcended conventional economic theory, when the fact is that they have failed to comprehend it. In short, the actual level of discussion is lower than any of the participants imagines. Copyright 1996 by Oxford University Press.},

The results presented in the paper seek to assist in assessing the competitive performance of the LVC in Iran. In addition, based on Porter's diamond of competitive advantages, the aim is to provide recommendations to improve the competitive performance of the industry., – An economic method, i.e. revealed comparative advantage (RCA), as a well‐known approach, is used to investigate the competitive performance of LVC in Iran. The LVC products analyzed in this research include hide, skin, leather manufacture, trunks and cases, and footwear. In addition, in order to investigate the factors which affect the low competitive performance, a questionnaire based on Porter's diamond of competitive advantages was designed and completed by researchers and practitioners working in the field of leather industry. Finally the reasons for low competitive performance of the industry are discussed., – The results reveal that the competitiveness of the Iranian LVC is low, compared with those of some other countries. China and Italy have superior comparative advantages in the period studied. The results also indicate that except one product, Iran has no comparative advantage in LVC industry. In addition, Iran has mainly focused on the upstream sector of LVC whereas China and Italy compete more in the downstream sector which offers more value added products. The results also reveal that among the elements studied, specialized factors, availability of capital, quality of demand and stability of macroeconomics highly influence the competitive performance of LVC in Iran. This is followed by subsequent recommendations on how best to improve the competitive performance of the industry., – The results of the investigation presented in this paper give an insight into the competitiveness of the LVC in Iran compared with nine other countries which play an important role in this industry in the world. The results also confirm that RCA can be used as an effective approach to assess the competitive performance of industries. Furthermore, reommendations provided in this paper assist in improving the competitive performance of the industry. In general, the findings should prove useful for both researchers and practitioners.},

Other than the Abbreviated Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI), studies do not provide an analysis of cultural or traditional beliefs and reflective dialogues on challenges of smallholder female livestock farmers. This study uses a mixed approach that includes a survey, A-WEAI, Pearson's chi-square coefficient, and reflective dialogue to analyze these challenges. The ability to adapt to agricultural drought is influenced by factors such as access to information, credit, productive resources, and available time, all of which are different for men and women. Our study found that 61.3\% and 16.4\% of the female and male farmers were disempowered. Domains that contributed the most to the disempowerment of the women and men were respectively time/workload (52.97\% and 31.89\%), access to and decisions on credit (17.7\% and 21.4\%), ownership of assets (11.3\% and 8.5\%), input into productive decisions (10\% and 9.1\%) and group membership (8\% and 19.13\%). No significant correlation for age, marital status, or level of education versus empowerment status of women was found. A significant correlation was observed between farming experience and the empowerment status of women. Reflective dialogue during interviews revealed that women struggled with access to finance, grazing, water, stock theft, lack of training and knowledge, and intimidation by male neighbors. Such findings help inform agricultural development strategies to develop or modify existing policies to enhance the resilience of farmers to agricultural drought and empowerment. Gender-specific agricultural projects should be encouraged to empower female farmers to improve their resilience to agricultural drought. The government should assist female livestock farmers in accessing credit and developing clear policies on land tenure issues. Mentorship programs should be encouraged to educate and support female smallholder farmers to enhance their agricultural drought resilience and empowerment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}/abstract{\textgreater}},

However, few empirical studies have considered how smallholders perceive climate change in Central Vietnam. This research investigates the Vietnamese smallholders’ views on the causes and indicators of climate change and factors that affect their perceptions of it in Central Vietnam. A sample size of 170 was drawn from a total of 297 smallholders and a structured questionnaire was developed to collect data. Descriptive, chi-square (χ2) and logistic regression analyses were used. The research results revealed that most smallholders perceived urbanization (93.5\%), followed by deforestation (85.3\%), air pollution (84.4\%) and unappropriated dealing with agricultural wastes (82.4\%) are the causes of climate change. A majority of smallholders perceived that excessive lightening (91.2\%), followed by change in rainfall season length (90.6\%), frequent droughts (90\%), change in temperature (88.2\%), uneven rainfall distribution (85.9\%), rainfall amount (84.1\%) and frequent floods (82.9\%) are the most noted indicators of climate change.

Among the independent variables, farming practice, information communication and technology (ICT) owned, community-based organisation participation, gender, type of household, credit programme participation and education level are significantly important determinants of smallholders’ perception on climate change.},

	abstract = {Social networks are becoming more and more popular, not only among young people looking for entertainment, but also among specialists, experts and researchers who wish to establish professional networks, develop business or research projects. They may be useful also for the comparison and evaluation of scientists and research organizations. This study aims to show how to build a framework of an analytical system for evaluation of researchers and research units using the data retrieved from an academic social network. Acquired data are used to find out the main differences between ResarchGate (RG) usage and values of metrics owned by scientists of different gender, scientific title and field of study to find out if various groups of employees can be directly compared. The authors apply web scraping technique for collecting data from university web page (2847 employees) and use R scripts to acquire the metrics form RG portal. Also, data of 1497 researchers and teaching workers from 11 faculties at Polish university were explored. The descriptive statistics, Chi square test, ANOVA and logistic regression were used to analyse the main RG metrics: RG Score, number of publications, reads and citations. Analysis shows the significant differences both in terms of popularity of ResearchGate and values of its main metrics. The research confirmed that 1) the rvest package allows for fast data acquisition from RG, 2) RG metrics can be used by university managers to compare achievements and progress of single researchers, research labs, departments or faculties, 3) Researchers employed at the faculties of formal and natural sciences use RG portal more frequently, possess higher values of RG metrics, therefore different types of workers and various branches of science shouldn't be compared directly.},

The Revealed Comparative Advantage index (RCA) was used to determine the development of the region’s exports. The RCA index is used in international economics for calculating the relative advantage or disadvantage of a certain country in a certain class of goods or services. The findings show that Burgenland has important exports of agricultural products and that economic relationships with neighbouring countries are deepening.

The hierarchy referred to variously as the ‘Knowledge Hierarchy’, the ‘Information Hierarchy’ and the ‘Knowledge Pyramid’ is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and ‘taken-for-granted’ models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff’s original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1016/J.GFS.2019.100338},
	abstract = {Global discourses on the governance of food security span competing approaches. For example, a neoliberal approach advocates commercialized, industrial agriculture, while food sovereignty and resilience are part of an alternative discourse to food security that prioritizes locally-based agroecological food production. Understanding how global discourses play out locally and how they impact the environment and biodiversity is important to identify appropriate pathways towards sustainability. In addition to their effects on food security, different approaches could reinforce or impede the success of biodiversity conservation because of the strong interdependence of food security and ecosystems. We applied the Q-methodology to examine alternative approaches to food security and biodiversity conservation pursued by 50 stakeholders from local to national levels in southwestern Ethiopia. We identified four distinct approaches, focusing on (1) smallholder commercialization, (2) agroecology and resilience, (3) local economy and equity, and (4) market liberalization. All approaches prioritized smallholders, but perspectives on how to achieve food security varied. Agricultural intensification, commercialization, and profit were widely considered important, while support for agroecology and resilience was largely restricted to non-government organizations. With the exception of supporters of the agroecology and resilience approach, biodiversity conservation was considered as a secondary goal. We conclude it is important to acknowledge plurality of food security approaches because local conditions are characterized by a multiplicity of stakeholder interests, and because food security is a complex problem that requires a multidimensional approach. However, major contradictions among existing approaches need to be reconciled, and the agroecology and resilience approach should be strengthened to ensure the sustainable achievement of food security and biodiversity conservation.},

Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews. Systematic reviews serve many critical roles. They can provide syntheses of the state of knowledge in a field, from which future research priorities can be identified; they can address questions that otherwise could not be answered by individual studies; they can identify problems in primary research that should be rectified in future studies; and they can generate or evaluate theories about how or why phenomena occur. Systematic reviews therefore generate various types of knowledge for different users of reviews (such as patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and policy makers).12 To ensure a systematic review is valuable to users, authors should prepare a transparent, complete, and accurate account of why the review was done, what they did (such as how studies were identified and selected) and what they found (such as characteristics of contributing studies and results of meta-analyses). Up-to-date reporting guidance facilitates authors achieving this.3 The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement published in 2009 (hereafter referred to as PRISMA 2009)45678910 …},

	abstract = {Innovation is central to the strategic orientations of many agronomic research institutes. Little attention has been paid, however, to the links between knowledge production and design processes, defined as processes resulting in the creation of new objects in pursuit of specific goals. Our aim was to analyze the conditions and specificities of the production of scientific knowledge on agro-ecosystems through design processes. Drawing on design theory, we carried out a cross-analysis of nine research projects that included design processes and produced innovative objects (for example blending rules for variety mixtures in low-input crop management routes). These projects were managed by researchers from a range of disciplines (agronomists, geneticists, crop physiologists, and ecologists), and varied in their duration (from three to 15 years) and scale (from plot to landscape). We combined semi-structured interviews with these researchers and the analysis of various documents (scientific papers, PhD theses, technical publications, and research projects or reports). Our findings show that in all case studies, original and general scientific knowledge on agro-ecosystem functioning was produced at various stages throughout the design processes. The originality of this knowledge lies with the new representations that emerged, either of the agro-ecosystem processes at stake, or of farmers' practices. We show that these representations were formed gradually, through successive iterations of both refined formulations of the design target and new knowledge produced, required for its design. Finally, our results highlight the role of confrontation with real-life situations (particularly through agronomic diagnosis or experiments) in the evolution of these representations. Engaging in design processes can thus be seen as a research practice that leads to the production of original knowledge, allowing for a greater diversity of actors' ways of knowing to be taken into account.},

Para o alcance de tais objetivos, utilizaram-se os índices de comércio intra-industrial, de GRUBEL e LLOYD (1975), e os índices de vantagem comparativa revelada, de BALASSA (1965) e LAURSEN (1998). Os indicadores de concentração de produtos e destino das exportações derivaram do coeficiente de Gini-Hirchman. Os dados utilizados foram obtidos no sistema ALICEWEB, do Ministério do desenvolvimento, Indústria e Comércio - MDIC. Os resultados encontrados revelaram alta concentração em poucos produtos primários e mercados de destinos, além da fraca participação de produtos manufaturados exportados. O estudo ainda apontou que o comércio internacional do estado é basicamente interindustrial, ou seja, exporta produtos primários e importa manufaturas, caracterizando um comércio do tipo Herckscher-Ohlin. entre os grupos de produtos com comércio intra-industrial, destacou-se o grupo do algodão, um sinal da importância do setor têxtil na economia estadual.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A metodologia utilizada permitiu avaliar, a partir de dados ex post, o desempenho competitivo dos segmentos do agronegócio, assim como os pontos fortes, fracos e neutros nas relações comerciais do Estado. Foram utilizados os índices: Gini-Hirschman; vantagem comparativa revelada (VCR); contribuição para o saldo comercial (CS); taxa de cobertura (TC) e comércio intraindústria (ICI). Os resultados mostraram que as exportações possuem uma forte dependência do agronegócio, com predominância dos segmentos carnes, complexo soja, complexo sucroalcooleiro e celulose. As exportações apresentam crescimento nos últimos quinze anos, porém a predominância dos segmentos do agronegócio vem sendo reduzida, nos últimos anos. O estudo permite concluir que importantes segmentos para o agronegócio do Estado apresentam elevada contribuição para o saldo comercial, entretanto, a baixa competitividade (VCR), sinaliza necessidade de investimentos nesses setores para um bom desempenho de Mato Grosso do Sul no comércio exterior. In this work, we aimed to characterize the exporter profile of the agribusiness in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, identifying which segments show comparative advantage - competitiveness -, who are the most competitive partners, as well as the developed marketing- type. The used methodology allowed the assessment, from ex post data, of the competitive performance of the agribusiness segments, as well as the strengths, weaknesses, and neutral points in commercial relations of the State. We used the following indexes: Gini-Hirschman, revealed comparative advantage (RCA), contribution for commercial balance (CB), coverage rate (CR), and intra-industry trade (IIT). According to results, exportations showed a strong dependence to the agribusiness, with predominance of segments of meat, soybean complex, sugar ethanol complex and cellulose. Exportations were found to be increasing over the last 15 years, however, with the parallel reduction of predominance of agribusiness segments in recent years. Therefore, we can conclude by saying that important segments for the agribusiness in the State show high contribution for commercial balance, but, the low competitiveness signalizes need of investments in this sectors for a good performance of the State in the foreign trade.},

This approach combines performance analysis and science mapping for detecting and visualizing conceptual subdomains (particular themes or general thematic areas). It allows us to quantify and visualize the thematic evolution of a given research field. To do this, co-word analysis is used in a longitudinal framework in order to detect the different themes treated by the research field across the given time period. The performance analysis uses different bibliometric measures, including the h-index, with the purpose of measuring the impact of both the detected themes and thematic areas. The presented approach includes a visualization method for showing the thematic evolution of the studied field.Then, as an example, the thematic evolution of the Fuzzy Sets Theory field is analyzed using the two most important journals in the topic: Fuzzy Sets and Systems and IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

We also identified non-use values related to avoidance of suffering, being able to further improve the welfare of dairy cows, the dairy farmer feeling good him/herself, ethical considerations, a feeling of doing the right thing, and animals eating properly (i.e. functioning as dairy cows should). Understanding the values underlying dairy farmers' decision making with respect to animal welfare is an important step in understanding why these farmers work with animal welfare.

	abstract = {Women comprise more than seventy per cent of those enrolled in the Kenya literacy programme. The reasons for this include: the limited formal educational opportunities available to females; the demands of a changing economy which have forced women to acquire extra responsibilities outside the home; the socializing opportunity made possible by literacy class attendance; flexible work schedules; and cultural beliefs which in some Kenyan communities discourage men from enrolling in the same literacy classes as women. Women literacy learners may find it difficult to sustain their interest in literacy learning because of: their multiple responsibilities; having to operate in environments not particularly conducive to learning; having to contend with professionally unqualified teachers; their limited exposure to reading materials and other learning aids; their very limited mastery of the two languages of official communication in Kenya; as well as the fact that the literacy programme is mainly administered by men. Although changes at the wider societal level still will, to the most part, determine the extent of women's participation in the Kenyan literacy programme, much could be accomplished through involving more of them in the programme's administration and by improving the quality of literacy instruction. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

	abstract = {The Conservation Agriculture Project (CAP) of the North Dakota Natural Resources Trust (Trust) has demonstrated a new concept for delivering conservation education that improves farm economics while enhancing environmental health, restoring landscape functions and providing societal benefits. The 5-year project, initiated by the Trust in 2000, incorporated Resource Analysis Teams to assist four farmers and farm families serving as a demonstration in developing and implementing holistic farm plans. Resource Analysis Team members were agricultural, environmental, conservation and economic professionals. Resource Analysis Teams met with each demonstration farm family twice each year in a non-threatening setting, usually around the family's kitchen table. The integration of diverse knowledge bases resulted in an educational roundtable with all participants being educators and students at the same time. As round-table participants became familiar with the intricacies of each particular farm and with each other, adversarial relationships dissolved and team members worked together to move the farms toward sustainability - economic, environmental and social. This approach differs from most federal conservation programs to date, which have approached on-farm conservation in a piecemeal manner, only protecting a parcel of land or a critical problem area. For those programs, responsibility for searching out and implementing conservation practices has fallen primarily on the farmer, who also has had to assume associated risks. The Conservation Agriculture Project has demonstrated that the Resource Analysis Team approach yields positive results for the environment, wildlife, farm families and society while enhancing information delivery and improving communication and acceptance among diverse groups with varying agendas. Most importantly, it has demonstrated the need and positive impacts of delivering conservation education directly to farmers and ranchers, who manage 43\% of the land nationwide. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

The link between these characteristics and livelihood constraints and strategies, capital assets and the role of communication is emphasised. Although the agroforestry innovation-decision process occurs in the absence of external intervention, by understanding the characteristics of adoptable innovations in the context of adoption behaviour, it may be possible to identify new roles for extensionists and scientists. They may be able to facilitate PTD through the identification of innovators and their innovations, optimise and adapt innovations with reference to the proposed model, and disseminate innovations to other smallholders who may benefit from them.},

We obtained data from semi-structured interviews of 98 households using participatory rural appraisal methods. Logistic regression models were used to explore factors that underlie farmers' attitudes towards agricultural production and their environmental awareness. Results indicated that low agricultural economic efficiency could result in less enthusiasm for agriculture among local farmers. This is a potential risk for China's food security and sustainable agricultural development. The backward development of the rural economy limited improvement of farmers' environmental awareness. Moreover, poor rural labour quality implied a lack of local participation in sustainable agriculture.

	abstract = {Annotation: Agricultural extension has a hundred-year background in Hungarian history. For years, this complex activity has been operated by agricultural higher education institutions, research institutes, state-owned farms and professional supervisor organisms. Changes in recent years in agriculture caused the transformation or abolishment of information and communication systems in Hungary. At the same time, small-scale enterprises formed (family farms, small-scale producers, native producers), whose need for information highly increased. Adequate communication systems have not been established and the conditions required for their operation do not exist, even though daily farm management requires a considerable amount of information. This raises the question of how to make the professional communication system more efficient and effective in transition. We aimed to identify, considering practical experiences, the most important tasks that interviewees had to perform day-to-day, the information producers' needs and their most effective forms of communication. This article represents the results of a survey of agricultural extension agents in three counties in eastern Hungary. Results emphasized the increased role of daily connection and technical support. Farmers have a high demand for information concerning administration and applications. The most effective manner of transferring information is during organized consultancy hours and local consultancy possibilities. Implications of the findings may contribute to the better reconstruction of the current extension system.},

Consequently, the approaches and tools of communicating with forest owners are under pressure towards becoming more customer-orientated. The present study looks at forestry advisory practices connected with forest management planning using the theory base and methods of activity theory and the active involvement of practical forestry professionals. Collaborative developmental meetings with a group of foresters were conducted in three organisations. A total of 22 sessions were held within separate developmental projects. Tacit knowledge and good communication practices were observed among the foresters involved in this. New flexible service models and improvements to current service chains were designed and experimented to support forest owners in their forest management activity. Analysis of experiences suggests adjusting forestry advisory practitioners' roles. A more meaningful customer-compatible role of the forest planner fostering the planner's work-related well-being could include two sub-roles: a mediator is sensitive to the owner's needs and wishes and s/he informs the owner about the forest holding and its various long-term opportunities and an activator, in turn, supports the realisation of the suggested operations in the forest holding. © 2011 Taylor \& Francis.},

	abstract = {Although potato is considered to be one of the strategic crops for ensuring food security in Ethiopia, the adoption of high yielding and disease tolerant improved potato varieties is low. Common explanations include farmers' attitudes to risk and socio-cultural factors. We develop a system perspective that explores farmers' decisions about adopting improved varieties (IVs) in relation to (1) their engagement with the agricultural knowledge and innovation system (AKIS) and (2) their preferences for local varieties (LVs). On the basis of original data from 346 ware Ethiopian potato farmers we show that the frequency of use of technical assistance from NGOs and access to credit positively affect the adoption of IVs while the use of the main buyer as a source of advice negatively affects IV adoption. We found that farmers have a preference for LVs because of the perceived easier crop management and better stew quality attributes. Yield, disease resistance, and maturity period are less important attributes. Higher education of the household head and the presence of a radio and/or television also have a positive effect on adoption. As to the scale of adoption, we found that only the percentage of owned land, tuber size (of ware potatoes), access to credit, stew quality, and presence of a mobile phone have an impact on ware potato farmers' decision on the amount of land to be used for growing IVs. These results imply that improved production-related quality attributes may not be enough to induce ware potato farmers to adopt new varieties. LVs with relatively low scores on production-related criteria continue to be appreciated by farmers due to demands from their customers. We recommend putting more emphasis on market-related quality attributes in new variety development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Helen Keller International's (HKI) homestead food production (HFP) model is a food- based strategy to increase the micronutrient intake of individuals, improve household food security and advance women's empowerment. The standard HFP intervention includes gardening, poultry production, group marketing, and nutrition behaviour change communication (BCC). The model has historically been implemented with smallholder households that have a minimal amount of land. However, individuals in ultra- poor households with minimal land access are among the most food- insecure and malnourished in Bangladesh, and they require food- based interventions targeted to their unique capabilities. Recognizing the urgent nutritional needs of the growing number of landless households in Bangladesh, HKI has been adapting its HFP model to reach this marginalized population. Targeting HFP to the landless, ultra- poor households in Bangladesh requires modification of the HFP package of support to focus on technologies that maximize yields and promote nutritionally rich varieties that can be produced on microplots. Given their limited production capacity and immediate income needs, interventions for the ultra- poor should also include skill- building and income- earning opportunities that are linked to agricultural production. Along with improving incomes or agricultural skills to improve access to food, the provision of nutrition education and counselling is essential for improving nutrition outcomes. Using the available literature and data sets from HKI's 20 year history of HFP in Bangladesh, this chapter briefly reviews the evidence of HFP's nutritional impact on the land constrained, summarizes programmatic challenges in working with this group, and proposes modifications to ensure that the most marginalized can derive equitable nutrition benefits from this food- based intervention.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farming systems often consist of a mosaic of interlinked forested and cleared-field patches that together provide a diversity of services to local and non-local stakeholders. Designing and adopting more sustainable farming systems for such mosaic landscapes involves communal decision-making and active participation of local smallholders. Currently, a wide variety of participatory approaches to involve individual farmers in such design processes is available. However, methodologies that address communal decision-making processes as seen in complex smallholder agricultural landscapes are still rare. Here, we present a gaming methodology developed to (i) actively involve farmers in the process of agroecosystem design, and (ii) to identify factors and patterns of communal decision-making through an in-depth analysis of game strategies deployed by participants. At the basis of this methodology is the RESORTES board game; a stylized yet complex land-use game rich in ecological and social outcomes. Results of four pilot sessions in a usufruct community in the buffer zone of a Man and Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, showed that the game sessions created an open and active discussion among participants. Discussions concerned land-use issues in the game and in real-life. It allowed participants that were new to active involvement in communal decision-making to openly discuss and share their ideas. The highly structured monitoring and analysis scheme for ex-ante/ex-post analysis was easy in use and identified communication, leadership and relatedness among participants as influential factors that smoothened the collective decision-making process. The RESORTES board game and related games can shed light on farmer's actual views on and responses to multifunctional agricultural landscape planning and the land sharing vs. land sparing dilemmas currently in debate in academic and policy-making settings. The findings of this paper can be useful to inform strategies for community involvement in agroecosystem design in a broader set of complex socio-environmental context, using serious game to guide agricultural landscape planning processes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange Limited (KACE) was incorporated in 1992 but formally launched in 1997 to address the challenges facing farmers in Kenya, especially poor smallholder farmers, in accessing input and output markets. A commercial for-profit model was chosen in order to charge clients modest fees for services rendered and raise revenue to sustain the services in the long term. The KACE model has evolved through various stages over time, with KACE developing, testing and experimenting with various platforms to link smallholder farmers to more remunerative markets. This article describes the various platforms, the challenges that were experienced and how they were addressed at each stage in the evolution. Chronologically, these platforms consisted of a physical trading floor, market information points (MIP), information and communication technology (ICT)-based platforms (short messaging service - SMS, interactive voice response service - IVRS, Internet based website and electronic database and radio), market resource centres (MRC), and a market call centre (MCC). Thus, the challenge experienced by KACE has been to find the right mix or portfolio of appropriate and affordable technology platforms, with complementary human skill and capacity, to efficiently manage the technologies, as well as the revenue flows, towards increased technical and financial sustainability. Despite the challenges, the KACE model continues to evolve and function, with a social entrepreneurial spirit of determination, to provide a solution to the social problem of poor smallholder farmers in Kenya, and God and technology willing, in the rest of Africa. The ICT platforms are being upgraded to improve technical and financial performance and efficiency, and the MRC staff are being trained to improve their capacity to generate and manage revenue efficiently.},

The levels of knowledge and awareness of the dangers to the environment and human health were investigated by questionnaires for farmers (209) and retailers (20) in two rural regions (Qianyang County (S1) and Chencang County (S2)) of the Wei River catchment in China where the modes of farming and the state of erosion are very different. The results showed that farmers learned the use and dangers of pesticides mainly by oral communication (p\&\#60; 0.01). Protective measures were inadequate; 65\% (S1) and 55\% (S2) of farmers never used any protective measures during spraying (p\&\#60; 0.05). Washing hands ({\textgreater}. 70\%) was the most common mode of personal hygiene, relative to wearing masks, showering, and changing clothes, but no significant differences were observed between the selected regions. Most pesticide wastes were dumped directly onto the land or into water, suggesting that educational measures should be taken to address the potential risks from the residues in the wastes. Over 85\% of farmers (S1 and S2) claimed to use illegal pesticides, but the reasons for their use varied (p\&\#60; 0.01). Retailers were well-informed and highly conscious of their responsibility for the safe use of pesticides, especially in S2 (p\&\#60; 0.01).

	abstract = {Agricultural extension in Indonesia has undergone major policy changes, depending on the government in power. In particular, since 1998, the government passed Law No 16/2006, aimed at making the extension system more democratic and participatory, especially for smallholder farmers. Law No. 16/2006 is in line with the “pluralistic and demand-driven extension approach” adopted by many developing countries since 2000, which allowed public and private extension systems to exist side-byside. Success of the new extension approach rests on the degree to which extension workers are able to mobilize smallholder farmers for “demand-driven” development that bases extension on smallholder farmers' needs. This survey of 78 public extension workers in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia examined challenges in implementing the pluralistic and demand-driven extension approach, including training needed to help extension workers deal more effectively with these challenges. The study found that the challenges relate to agreeing on extension goals; eliciting collaboration with non-government agencies and other development partners; and using ICTs to narrow the farmers-to-agent ratio. In general, the study found that extension workers need training in communication and development, also known as communication for development (C4D) to effectively facilitate development and navigate the increasing complexity of development programming in the 21st century. Thus, we recommend C4D training for extension workers as a way of enhancing their effectiveness. Fortunately, the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are promoting this strategy. Therefore, we urge the government of Indonesia to explore C4D as a strategy for strengthening extension in the country.},

	volume = {10},
	issn = {1712-8277},
	abstract = {Since around 1990, Indonesia had been importing about 40\% of its entire beef consumption. To reduce its reliance on imports, Indonesia launched the beef self-sufficiency programme (BSSP), which operated between 2005 and 2014, with the aim being to reduce imports of beef cattle to 10\% of national demand by 2014. This was particularly challenging at the time because the demand for beef had continuously increased for a number of years. The aim of this case study was to investigate how Indonesian smallholder farmers perceived their own beef-cattle production in line with the BSSP, with a particular focus on the way in which the programme was implemented. The present study is based on the findings from 14 semi-structured qualitative interviews carried out with smallholder beef-cattle farmers from the Central Java Province in Indonesia. A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data, using the software program Transana. The study showed that the farmers were mostly unaware of the existing government policies on beef-cattle farming, i.e., regarding the BSSP, including the overall aim of these policies. Furthermore, the activities they did know about they viewed as individual activities run in isolation, rather than parts of a grander plan or overall larger targeted programme-note, in this paper, we refer to these individual activities as `fragments'. The farmers who took part in the interviews outlined the challenges they faced in increasing the quantity and quality of their beef cattle. The participating farmers also outlined their experiences of how elements of the BSSP were presented to them and how these initiatives were taken up (by themselves, colleagues, or in the local community). The results of the present study show that the farmers were mostly not aware of the overarching policies like BSSP, and hence there is a clear need for the government, i.e., via the Livestock and Fishery Office, to improve how it disseminates knowledge and information about its policy programmes, particularly to the players most affected by those policies. We identified a clear need for the relevant government institutions to take the initiative and work more closely with the main players, in this case the beef-cattle farmers. Involving the farmers is considered crucial in order to create and maintain sustainable beef production. Considering the farmers' perspectives of how extension agents approach the practical implementation of governmental agricultural policy programme, such as the BSSP, we furthermore suggest that more transparent communication is needed, together with the closer involvement of farmers in all stages of the programme, i.e., not just in implementation, but also in the design and planning stages, as well as in the post-programme evaluation, in order to learn effective lessons to improve future programme delivery.},

Through such adaptation, farmers would gain better access to information and new markets and a better position in negotiations. Overall, they would become better managers of their businesses. The Internet, coupled with other information and communication technologies (ICT), represents a tool for linking up different interest groups within the vertical agricultural chain. The role and significance of ICT and information literacy within agricultural activities is presented through a review of European development initiatives and theoretical insights regarding this topic. To reveal obstacles (objective and subjective), the current level of skills and the readiness to adopt new knowledge and technologies, a survey was conducted on a representative sample of inhabitants from rural areas, i. e. farmers, since they are a determining factor of such changes. The present paper is part of the research exploring a wider context of ICT implementation aimed at enhancing farmers' competencies, and consequently, enhancing overall agricultural performance. The analysis seeks to confirm the basic hypothesis that there are objective and subjective obstacles, but also the interest and willingness to increase the level of knowledge in the observed social unit.},

An interdisciplinary network of European scientists put forward visions for future crop production embracing the complexity of our socio-ecological system by applying the principle of diversity at all levels from soil micro-organisms to plant varieties and cropping systems. This approach, integrated with careful deployment of our finite global resources and implementation of appropriate sustainable technology, appears to be the only way to ensure the scale of system resilience needed to cope with many of our concerns. We discuss some of the most important tools such as (i) building soil fertility by recycling of nutrients and sustainable use of other natural and physical resources, (ii) enhancing biological diversity by breeding of crops resilient to climate change and (iii) reconnecting all stakeholders in crop production. Finally, we emphasise some of the changes in agricultural and environmental regulation and policy needed in order to implement the visions. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.},

The investigations, consisting of an exploratory case study in Ghana followed by a survey with 285 observations in Benin, demonstrated that market information asymmetry indeed leads to lower prices for farmers. In Ghana, market price alerts through mobile phone messaging allowed decreasing transaction costs for farmers from US \$2 to US \$150 per transaction. In Benin, most farmers who are using mobile phones are WTP a premium of up to US\$2.5 per month to get market price and quality information. Econometric models showed that decisive factors for the premium to be paid include farm location, market channel, profit margin, contact with agricultural extension services and technical support from buyers.

	abstract = {Background: Access to agricultural knowledge is important in transforming livelihoods of those relying on agriculture for a living and in enhancing food security. This access to agricultural knowledge is influenced by infrastructure needed for information dissemination. However, information infrastructure is not uniformly distributed within and between countries. It is because of this that some of the farming communities are information rich while others are information poor. In Tanzania, the agricultural sector is characterised by poor research-extension-farmers linkage and inaccessibility of agricultural knowledge at farm levelObjective: The study investigated the factors influencing access to agricultural knowledge among smallholder rice farmers in the Kilombero district of Tanzania. Specifically, the study identified categories of agricultural knowledge needed by farmers, determined how farmers access agricultural knowledge, and assessed the factors limiting the accessibility of agricultural knowledge among rice farmers in the Kilombero district.Method: Quantitative data were collected via semi-structured questionnaires administered face-to-face with rice farmers, community leaders, and agricultural agents in four villages at the Kilombero district of the Morogoro region in Tanzania.Results: The key finding indicates that farmers accessed and used agricultural knowledge in undertaking agricultural activities. It was further revealed that the level of acquisition of agricultural knowledge increased with an increase in age. Farmers needed agricultural knowledge on land preparation, seed selection, and rice planting, while few acquired knowledge on agricultural markets. Among the agricultural knowledge sources used, demonstration plots and agricultural extension agents were found to be used by the majority of the farmers. It was also found that a limited number of demonstration plots, late delivery of information services, a limited number of agricultural extension agents, and poor information and communication technologies infrastructure hindered access to agricultural knowledge among rice farmers in the district.Conclusion: A strong public–private partnership is needed to enhance access to agricultural knowledge in rural areas. In this regard, the government should set up policies and strategies that motivate private sector investment and involvement in provision of agricultural knowledge in rural areas. The private sector should extend their agricultural-related activities to most rural areas so that more people can have access to agricultural knowledge.Keywords: smallholder farmers; agricultural knowledge; access to knowledge;access to information; Tanzania},

Meeting market demand on time and avoiding market ‘floods’ is a challenge among communal farmers, leading to post harvest losses partly due to lack of information and uninformed decision making. Mobile phones have potential to connect farmers to markets, close the information gap and enable informed decisions. Currently most farmers target a few markets leading to market ‘floods’, low prices and fresh produce deterioration while some potential markets remain untapped. A survey conducted in 2015 covering 131 farmers in Svosve-Wenimbi, Marondera district of Mashonaland East province in Zimbabwe evaluated mobile phone ownership and use in farming; and its potential in transforming production and marketing. High literacy and mobile phone ownership of 95.32\% and 94.45\% respectively was reported, with 16\% already accessing advisory services over mobile phone. 51.1\% utilised various mobile phone services including accessing market information on inputs and produce, advisory services, weather data, mobile phone money transfers for transaction and crop insurance. By using mobile phones farmers made informed decisions and saved time and transport cost.

We find that time to adoption averages only 4. years, but is shorter on larger farms. Factors that speed variety change also differ by farm size. Extension and media sources of information significantly influence adoption among larger farmers relative to information gained through social relationships, but this is not the case for marginal farmers. Traits related to consumption quality speed adoption on smaller wheat farms, where families both sell and consume their wheat; higher yields drive adoption for the most subsistence-oriented, marginal group.},

This article evaluates whether a role-playing game (RPG) is an effective participatory tool to encourage social learning and collective action among local stakeholders towards adoption of CSA strategies. We designed and implemented an RPG with three groups of farmers in Apuí (Southern Amazonas), evaluating the game's impact on social learning by interviewing each farmer before and after the RPG.

Two types of projects are evaluated and compared: community projects (CPs) at six primary schools, and an intensive two-week permaculture design certification (PDC) programme. Our results suggest that both PDC and CP participants felt that they had benefited from the projects. However, PDC participants developed a more comprehensive understanding of permaculture, felt empowered and frequently related permaculture to their own traditional cultural values whereas CP participants often misunderstood permaculture, felt frustrated by the limited immediate economic benefits and frequently contrasted permaculture against traditional cultural values. These differences may have occurred because CP participants had fewer opportunities to interact directly with the permaculture teachers, to ask questions, or to clarify points of uncertainty. This study emphasizes the importance of direct, reciprocal communication between NGOs and project participants for fostering feelings of autonomy and competence, thereby strengthening resilient agroecological systems.},

A cartilha também visou divulgar opções de estratégias adaptativas desenvolvidas pelos próprios atores locais. Uma equipe de pesquisa interdisciplinar, integrante da sub-rede Mudanças Climáticas e Desenvolvimento Regional (MCDR/Rede CLIMA), conduziu 1.140 entrevistas semiestruturadas em quatro áreas do Semiárido brasileiro: Seridó Potiguar-RN, Gilbués-PI, Juazeiro-BA e Chapada do Araripe-CE. Os questionários aplicados levantaram, entre outros, dados sobre as percepções dos agricultores familiares a respeito das mudanças do clima, seus valores culturais e suas expectativas a respeito do futuro dos seus modos de vida rurais. A partir dessas informações, criou-se uma cartilha educativa para restituir os dados coletados. Privilegiando o diálogo e a troca de saberes ou, nas palavras de Habermas, “a negociação da definição de situação”, o instrumento de comunicação escolhido partiu do pressuposto de que as comunidades tendem a confiar em novas informações quando estas possuem, na sua percepção, relevância, credibilidade e legitimidade. Os resultados gerais da experiência demonstraram que possíveis barreiras sociais e culturais (tais como a incompreensão inicial entre cientistas e usuários do conhecimento) podem ser superadas por meio de ações colaborativas entre a academia, os tomadores de decisão e os usuários finais. A elaboração da cartilha encorajou o trabalho horizontal para identificar riscos climáticos e possíveis medidas de adaptação.},

Yet the adoption rate of conservation agriculture is still low. Our paper analyses the factors affecting farmers’ willingness to adopt conservation agriculture in Lebanon. The findings show that household characteristics—years of farming and farm size affect conservation agriculture adoption. However, household characteristics alone were insufficient to explain conservation agriculture adoption. We found that farming experience, information sources, frequency of irrigation, and severity of weed infestation in the past, participation in specific trainings, and farmers’ perception about the long-term impact of conservation agriculture, were key determinants of conservation agriculture adoption. Our paper encourages policymakers to invest in conservation agriculture to overcome food insecurity and environmental changes affecting food systems in the Middle East. The paper also informs agribusiness firms to view conservation agriculture as a viable alternative to strengthen their business relationship with farmers in arid and semi-arid regions.},

Thirty-six farmers who visited a plant clinic in one of three countries (Malawi, Costa Rica and Nepal) were given at least one diagnosis of a plant health problem and up to six options for managing the problem. Almost all of the farmers were able to use at least some of these management recommendations. Communication was verbal, but reinforced in writing; all of the farmers received a one-page prescription form that summarized the recommendation. Communication per se was rarely the reason farmers failed to adopt technologies. Farmers who opted not to use recommendations often had logical, material reasons for doing so, and they showed a preference for chemical control. Of the 31 farmers who were advised to apply pesticides (including organic ones), 23 people (74\%) accepted this advice to spray, but only 14 of 22 farmers (54\%) tried advice for cultural or biological control. Farmers’ response to an innovation is too complex to always describe as accepted vs rejected, and this decision depends on the fit of the technology itself, and on the quality of how the innovation is communicated.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to comparatively assess the most suitable channels for dissemination of agricultural innovations along the entire information value chain. Design/Methodology/Approach: We calculated information scores to measure channel preference from a randomly selected sample of farmers: 285 in Tamale, Ghana and 300 in Kakamega, Kenya. Using t-tests we compared the information score differences of different channels between farmers who adopted Integrated Soil Fertility Management and those who did not. Findings: The highest information scores were observed for radio along the entire value chain for both locations. However, farmers in Tamale prefered interpersonal channels for processing information. Radio and farmer field days had the highest rankings for production information at both locations. Radio, workshops and interpersonal channels (traders and neighbours/friends/relatives) were best-bet channels for marketing and procesing information. Practical implication: Extension agents should place more emphasis on channels such as radio, farmer field days, and workshops as they may offer more efficient delivery of information packages at all levels, whilst recognizing the central role of interpersonal channels. Theoretical implication: The nexus between the uses and gratification, adoption, diffusion of innovations theories and the collaborative communication theory on one hand, and the agricultural product value chain framework on the other, is highlighted. Farmers’ preference for information channels is not predicated on the stage of the value chain. Originality/Value: In the current context of weak agricultural knowledge and innovation systems in African agriculture, agricultural producers are poorly informed about the current innovations. This study furnishes empirical evidence on the best-bet information channels to be used by extension workers and change agents to disseminate and communicate system innovations.},

The predicted efficiency score from the stochastic frontier production function showed that the farmers had a mean technical efficiency score of 40.2\%, implying that their output could be increased substantially if improvements were made to existing input mixes. The variables related to educational level and radio and mobile telephone access were positively linked to a farmer's technical efficiency. The estimated results also indicated that farmers with a higher degree of commercialisation were technically more efficient compared to those with lower market participation.

Makerere University, Kampala, in response piloted a farmer entrepreneurship training project in a bid to effectively contribute to social transformation. The study assessed the influence of the training on smallholder farmers’ competences, productivity and organizational capacity. Data were collected using semi- structured questionnaires and focus group discussions with 184 farmers in the project and non-project farmers in northern Uganda. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using SPSS computer package and thematic content analysis, respectively. A multiple regression analysis using the ordinary least square was used to capture the combined influence of entrepreneurship training and other socioeconomic variables on the farmers’ productivity. Our study findings show that the training had positively influenced farmers’ entrepreneurial and organizational competences. Farmers acquired improved agronomic practices, business planning, value addition and packaging, branding and marketing knowledge and skills. Group leadership, accountability, communication, networking and marketing competencies of the farmers were strengthened. The project demonstrated a possible framework for developing country university efforts to impact on sustainable agricultural development. Integrating entrepreneurship aspects of technical and scientific knowledge, entrepreneurship, social and environmental awareness, experiential education and values and ethics into the curricula would provide universities with capacity to promote rural entrepreneurship.},

	abstract = {A farmer or a dairy consultant's ability to identify and properly treat lame dairy cows is key to managing lameness on farms. However, this ability is dependent on their knowledge and perceptions regarding lameness. To date these topics are poorly understood in all dairy systems. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a qualitative approach to describe the perception of lameness in Brazilian pasture-based dairy farms. The aim of this study was firstly, to contextualize farmers and dairy consultants’ culture and knowledge on the topic of lameness and, secondly, to understand how these factors may influence lameness management on the farms. In-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews were done with participating farm owners (n = 21) and dairy consultants (n = 13). Thematic analyses of the interview content provided evidence that the dairy community's overarching culture around lameness acts as a barrier preventing positive actions targeting lameness control and prevention. The emerging themes identified indicate that lameness is a vague, ill-defined concept among both farmers and dairy consultants working in this region. There was a shared belief that pasture-based systems have a low risk for lameness. Furthermore, the prevailing culture for tackling lameness was reactive, particularly in the case of lame cows affected by physical trauma or environmental factors. Treatment was frequently delayed and the misuse of antibiotics was evident. Described community culture was rationalised via the cognitive dissonance and health belief models. We suggest that increased dialogue, including educational efforts within the community, may lead to increased sensitivity of risk perception of lameness within the community and in turn trigger appropriate diagnosis and treatment of lame cows.},

	abstract = {Food insecurity remains a persistent problem, affecting one-third of Tanzania’s population. Mutually reinforcing factors that make the situation more acute include high human population growth combined with the impacts of climate change affecting agricultural productivity. This situation explains why the development and implementation of solutions to improve food security in Tanzania continues to receive substantial attention from scholars, NGOs, practitioners, government and associated bodies. Among researchers and practitioners, innovation is discussed as one possible and widely accepted pathway for improving food security. However, evidence shows that the adoption of innovations that have a potential to improve food security status, such as improved seed, fertilizer, better cooking stoves or mechanization, remains low in Tanzania. To enhance understanding about why innovations are not always successfully adopted, we took an innovation system perspective that included three analytical steps: (1) description of system arrangements on a meso- and macro level, (2) the description of farmers’ motivation for adoption or rejection on a micro-level, and (3) an integration of findings from both levels to identify entry points for purposeful intervention. This paper applied that framework to the empirical examples of two innovations, improved cooking stoves (ICS) and fertilizer micro-dosing (FMD) combined with improved soil and crop management techniques for small-scale subsistence-farmer groups in Tanzania. These interventions were part of the Trans-SEC research project. We show how system constraints, such as hampered communication and interaction across levels, had an impact on the way innovations could be implemented by farmers and how this leads to specific adoption decisions, given conditions of not-knowing or insufficient information. From these two case studies we conclude that most technical based innovations are associated with process aspects (in the case of fertilizer micro-dosing) or social aspects (with stoves).},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers and livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa are on the frontlines of climate variability and change. Yet, in many regions, a paucity of weather and climate data has prevented rigorous assessment of recent climate trends and their causes, thereby limiting the effectiveness of forecasts and other services for climate adaptation. In rainfed systems, farmer perceptions of changing rainfall and weather patterns are important precursors for annual cropping decisions. Here, we propose that combining such farmer perceptions of trends in seasonal rainfall with satellite-based rainfall estimates and climate station data can reduce uncertainties regarding regional climatic trends. In western Uganda, a rural and climatically complex transition zone between eastern and central equatorial Africa, data from 980 smallholder households suggest distinct changes in seasonal bimodal rainfall over recent decades, specifically wetter rainy seasons and drier dry seasons. Data from three satellite-based rainfall products beginning in 1983 largely corroborate respondent perceptions over the last 10-20 years, particularly in the southernmost sites near Queen Elizabeth National Park. In addition, combining all three information sources suggests an increasing trend in annual rainfall, most prominently in the north near Murchison Falls National Park over the past two decades; this runs counter to recent research asserting the presence of a drying trend in the region. Our study is unique in evaluating and cross-validating these multiple data sources to identify climatic change affecting people in a poorly understood region, while providing insights into regional-scale climate controls.},

	abstract = {We consider the question of what is needed for climate services to support sub-Saharan African farmers' adaptation needs at the scale of the climate challenge. Consistent with an earlier assessment that mutually reinforcing supply-side and demand-side capacity constraints impede the development of effective climate services in Africa, our discussion of strategies for scaling up practices that meet farmers' needs, and opportunities to address long-standing obstacles, is organized around: (a) meeting farmers' climate information needs; (b) supporting access, understanding and use; and (c) co-production of services. A widespread gap between available information and farmers' needs is associated with entrenched seasonal forecast convention and obstacles to using observational data. Scalable innovations for producing more locally relevant historical and forecast climate information for farm decision-making are beginning to be adopted. Structured participatory communication processes help farmers relate complex climate information to their experience, and integrate it into their management decisions. Promising efforts to deliver rural climate services strategically combine communication channels that include participatory processes embedded in existing agricultural advisory systems, and innovations in interactive broadcast media. Efforts to engage farmers in co-production of climate services improve delivery to farmers and dialogue among stakeholders, but often with little impact on the usability of available information. We discuss challenges and options for capturing farmers' evolving demands, and aggregating and incorporating this information into iterative improvements to climate services at a national scale. We find evidence that key weaknesses in the supply and the demand sides of climate services continue to reinforce each other to impede progress toward meeting farmers' needs at scale across Africa. Six recommendations target these weaknesses: (1) change the way seasonal forecasts are produced and presented regionally and nationally, (2) use merged gridded data as a foundation for national climate information products, (3) remove barriers to using historical data as a public good, (4) mobilize those who work on the demand side of climate services as an effective community of practice, (5) collectively assess and improve tools and processes for communicating climate information with rural communities, and (6) build iterative co-production processes into national climate service frameworks.},

It therefore seeks to examine the dynamics of the use of mobile phone among poultry farmers in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. One hundred and fifty poultry farmers selected from the Greater Accra Region were interviewed using structured questionnaires. The study showed a high penetration of mobile phones among the poultry farmers. A regression analysis showed that demographic variables such as age, sex, educational level, experience and size of holdings influenced the use of mobile phone. Network failure was cited as the major constraint to the use of mobile phones. There is the need for the required investment to build a more robust infrastructural base for the use of mobile phone as it remains a critical tool to supporting agricultural extension delivery among Ghanaian farmers.},

	abstract = {Globally, forest ecosystems are shrinking and their health is declining due to a range of biotic and abiotic factors. Forest ecosystems in Pakistan are no exception and the country faces a crisis as its growing population ([ 208 million) places increasing pressure on the country's food production systems and forest resources. Effective food systems that enhance productivity, increase economic outputs, improve ecological outcomes and maintain social acceptance are needed. Agroforestry, a traditional land management system in Pakistan, offers the opportunity to meet these goals. Planting trees on private farmland provides clear ownership of any timber resource and well managed systems have great potential both to boost agriculture and reduce wood shortages. Concerted extension efforts have been made to introduce and promote innovative agroforestry practices in Pakistan, but the success of these efforts depends on many factors. This paper reviews some of the current constraints to agroforestry promotion in Pakistan, including attitudes of the extension staff, poor or weak research-extension coordination, lack of trained personnel, lack of farmer response to advice, tree species limitations, and market mechanism as well as wood price challenges. Establishing model agroforestry farms at the village level can be a productive extension approach, but successful extension programming requires partners to share both an appreciation of the problem and a vision of successful outcomes. Successful promotion also requires appropriate choice of message, messenger, target audience and effective use of appropriate communication tools. Remedial measures to streamline the existing systems and devise future sustainable strategies and approaches are suggested to promote agroforestry in Pakistan.},

As access to proven agricultural information is crucial to farmers, this study examined how Community Radio Broadcast (CRB) could be used to complement agricultural extension service delivery in South Africa targeting smallholder farmers. A total of 167 community radio stations (CRS) with usable data were analysed from South Africa. Based on programming format, language of communication used, listenership and target audience by CRS, a questionnaire was prepared for station managers. All public domain CRS websites were accessed to analyse the programming. The results indicated that amongst the sampled CRS, local languages are popular for programme presentations with English being used by more than 50\% of the CRS. The target audience was varied and diversified; however, only 2.85\% out of nine provinces are targeting farmers. Listenership distribution is large, cutting across different age groups with an average listenership of 964 000/province/day. However, the number of agricultural programmes aired on South African CRS is very limited. In an attempt to use CRB as an avenue for reaching the smallholder farmers, the study suggests an Agricultural Radio Information System (ARIS) model as a strategy to complement agricultural extension advisory services of South Africa.},

Overall, the study finds that interactive ICT tools and platforms are valuable in their capacity to improve the quality of agricultural extension and climate information services and, as such, can help smallholder farmers better manage predicted risks on the farm and elsewhere in the agriculture sector. The scope of impact in most of these projects, however, was largely premised on the numbers of beneficiaries reached (e.g., with information pertaining to an innovation). The efficacy of scaled-up results to achieve positive, long-lasting livelihood impacts in smallholder agriculture is more complex, and often requires effecting systemwide change on multiple dimensions, e.g., in societal values, institutional arrangements, market relations, and policy decision making. The scaling process here requires long-term attention, even if the impacts are not immediately apparent.},

Globally, the benefits of m-Agri services include facilitating farmers’ access to financial services and sourcing agricultural information about input use, practices, and market prices. There are very few published literature sources that focus on the potential benefits of m-Agri services in Africa and none of which explore their sustainability. This study, therefore, explores the evolution, provision, and sustainability of these m-Agri services in Africa. An overview of the current landscape of m-Agri services in Africa is provided and this illustrates how varied these services are in design, content, and quality. Key findings from the exploratory literature review reveal that services are highly likely to fail to achieve their intended purpose or be abandoned when implementers ignore the literacy, skills, culture, and demands of the target users. This study recommends that, to enhance the sustainability of m-Agri services, the implementers need to design the services with the users involved, carefully analyse, and understand the target environment, and design for scale and a long-term purpose. While privacy and security of users need to be ensured, the reuse or improvement of existing initiatives should be explored, and projects need to be data-driven and maintained as open source. Thus, the study concludes that policymakers can support the long-term benefit of m-Agri services by ensuring favourable policies for both users and implementers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Farmers were buying, storing, and use pesticides on cultivated plants with no or little consideration of the effect on honeybees. In Ethiopia, pesticide poisoning of honeybees has increased from time to time, and beekeepers also lose their colonies due to unwise use and improper practice of pesticides. Ethiopia has developed a legal framework on pesticide registration, distribution, and use. But regulations are not strictly implemented by the farmers, and it needs enforcement. Farmers use pesticides on crops with no or little consideration of their effect on honeybees, also the use of pesticides is harmful to pollination service, behavior, communication, forage resource, poisoning, and contaminated hive products. The Effective communication between beekeepers and crop growers is important because spraying pesticides is required to minimize the impact of pesticides on honeybees.

However, a greater understanding is needed regarding the types of m-services available to farmers, how farmers access that information, and possible factors affecting m-service use. With a study of smallholder farming communities in central Kenya, we examine factors affecting the likelihood of Kenyan farmers' adoption of m-services specifically related to agriculture and livestock information, buying and selling products, and alerts about agricultural or livestock activities. According to a survey of 577 farming households, 98\% of respondents own a mobile phone. Approximately 25\% use it to access information about agriculture and livestock, 23\% access information about buying and selling products, and 18\% receive alerts. Personal smartphone ownership increases the likelihood of m-services use (p {\textless} .001), as does membership in farmer organizations (p {\textless} .001). We find that age and income are not significantly related to m-service use, and we discuss this result in terms of intersections between smartphone ownership, gender, and education. Consistent with prior qualitative research, our quantitative results further support the need for m-services providers to design for basic or feature phone users for improved dissemination of agro-meteorological information.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Farmers’ access to reliable information is crucial to improving rural livelihoods, food security, and national economies in West Africa. This paper discusses the dynamics of accessing and using agricultural learning videos from commercial channels, vs project and non-project channels in Benin and Mali. Using combinations of different models to assess the effectiveness of agricultural extension programs, the findings showed that farmers were motivated to pay for videos and watch them by themselves, without facilitation. Farmers who watched the videos through project support have also continued to watch on their own if the videos are of interest to them. Nevertheless, farmers were less motivated in the learning process when they received the Digital Video Disc (DVD) free and without support to watch them. We also found that the distribution of learning videos through commercial channels reaches more serious users and increases farmers’ self-determination for learning, and farmers are more motivated to provide feedback than viewers who receive DVDs for free or via project support, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), or farmer organizations. Although buying a DVD is an individual action, they like to watch the videos in groups. After buying the DVD, about 43\% of respondent borrowed DVD players and one person in five bought a DVD player to watch the videos. Efforts to promote improved technologies need to expand beyond the conventional focus on research and extension services. Support to agricultural technology dissemination must go beyond assistance to smallholder farmers and NGOs (practical implication). As the private sector has a role to play, both in making technologies available and in teaching farmers how to use them, their contribution would create space for innovation (theoretical implication). Our findings suggest that successful development intervention programs can be sell audiovisual material to farmers, who will use it proactively.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Milk production was the most recorded data and analyses showed that mean yield in litres per cow (10.7 ± 0.14) was similar to average estimate in literature for Malawi (10.4 ± 1.57). Household daily milk consumption (1.2 ± 0.04), milk sold through formal market (610.0 ± 55) and amount of milk rejected per day per MBG (5.9 ± 0.86) in litres were captured. Farmers asked questions and received timely feedback via SMS. Therefore, it is possible to capture quality data using SMS technology that is adequate for conducting analyses to inform decision-making.},

This study develops a framework to investigate the cognitive and affective behavioural drivers of smallholder farmersíntention to use a smartphone in a developing country context. For this, survey data was collected from 664 randomly selected small-scale farmers in Bihar State, India in 2016. The analysis included a partial least square estimation of the behavioural model. The results confirm positive influences on the intention to use a smartphone for agricultural purposes through subjective norms, attitude, self-control, as well as positive and negative anticipated emotions. There is no evidence that negative anticipated emotions related to failure outweighed other factors. These results extend the academic literature with new conceptual insights and provide application-oriented implications for stakeholders, such as NGOs, extension services and research institutes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Many West African farmers are struggling to cope with changing weather and climatic conditions. This situation limits farmers’ ability to make optimal decisions for food and income security. Developing more useful and accessible weather and climate information services (WCIS) can help small-scale farmers improve their adaptive capacity. The literature suggests that such WCIS can be achieved if forecast information is produced jointly by farmers and scientists. To test this hypothesis and derive design requirements for effective WCIS, we evaluated the outcomes of an experimental coproduction of weather forecasts in Ada, Ghana. The experiment involved a user-driven design and testing of information and communications technology (ICT)-based digital (smartphones and apps) and rainfall monitoring tools by 22 farmers. They collected data and received weather forecasts during the 2018/2019 study period. The results showed a positive evaluation of the intervention, expressed by the level of engagement, the increase in usability of the tools and understanding of forecast uncertainty, outreach capacity with other farmers, and improved daily farming decisions. The success of the intervention was attributed to the iterative design process, as well as the training, monitoring, and technical support provided. We conclude that the application of modern technology in a coproduction process with targeted training and monitoring can improve smallholder farmers’ access to and use of weather and climate forecast information.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A case study of the intention of Indonesian coffee farmers to use a tree canopy trimming technique in pine–based agroforestry highlights path-dependency and complexity of social-ecological relationships. Farmers have contracts permitting coffee cultivation under pine trees owned by the state forestry company but have no right to fell trees. A multidisciplinary international team of scientists supported farmers at the University of Brawijaya Forest in East Java to trial canopy trimming to improve light for coffee production while maintaining tree density. Data were collected using surveys through interviews, case study analysis using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and nonparticipant observations. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, we found that though farmer attitudes toward trimming techniques were positive, several factors needed to be scrutinized: perceived limited socio-policy support and resources. While there is hope that canopy trimming can improve coffee production and local ecosystem services, a participatory and integrative extension and communication strategy will be needed. In the relationship between farmers as agents and forest authorities as principals, any agroforestry innovation needs to incorporate knowledge and concerns in the triangle of farmers, policymakers and empirical science.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Cross-sectional farm household-level data from three hundred household heads were collected between September 2019 and March 2020 and triangulated with data from workshops with farmers and extension agents. The data were analyzed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance and the ordered probit model. Farmers’ socio-economic characteristics significantly affect their degree of interaction with extension agencies. Recognition of the determinants of the level of farmers’ interactions can inform policymakers about how to formulate and improve the effectiveness of extension programs, enhance information and knowledge dissemination and facilitate development in collaboration with local communities by focusing on a better interaction between farmers and extension agencies. The level of a farmer’s interactions is based on a systematic decision-making process. Although personal and demographic characteristics are important, farmers’ interaction levels require conducive institutional and household assets, groups/social capital and access to extension agents’ contexts. These contexts will differ by household, country and region. Therefore, extension agencies should create and design contextually appropriate strategies for substantial interactions with farmers for the dissemination of farm information. This research is original and valuable in identifying the factors associated with the level of farmers’ interactions with extension agencies in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. It also provides a new pathway for operationalizing farmer-oriented agricultural extension policies and strategies and to help agricultural policymakers formulate extension service programs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is common knowledge that women are culturally encouraged to mix-feed their infants, but the extent of these feeding practices is not known. The objective of this study was to identify the extent of mixed feeding/supplementation and the cultural/ social barriers to exclusive breastfeeding. All women surveyed introduced water and food supplementation prior to 6 months of age, with more than 38\% giving water in the first month of life. Mothers identified cultural factors influencing their decision to mix-feed their babies, which included 1) pressures by village elders and families to supplement because it is a traditional practice, 2) belief that breast milk is an incomplete food that does not increase the infants weight, 3) belief that all family members should receive the benefit of food grown in the family farm, and 4) the taboo of prohibiting sexual contact during breastfeeding. © 2005 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

	abstract = {In the Eduardo Mondlane irrigation scheme in Chokwe, southern Mozambique, land had been allocated in 1983 to approximately 12 000 farmers for growing rice (85\%) and maize (15\%). From the onset, maize production in the warm season was severely constrained by a number of pathogens and pests. During 1984-1988 a study on downy mildew, maize streak virus, stemborers and rodents, was carried out. This resulted in the formulation of a package of recommendations along lines of integrated pest and disease management, which was subsequently disseminated to farmers by the extension service. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of technology transfer, farmers were interviewed just before the new recommendations were disseminated (1988) and again two years after the start of the training and extension programme. Severe constraints in technology transfer to farmers were encountered due to the poor functioning of the extension service. It is concluded that improvements in communication and feedback mechanisms between farmers, extensionists and researchers and substitution of the prevailing 'top-down' training and extension methods by a 'bottom-up' approach are needed. In addition, rehabilitation and proper maintenance of the irrigation system and better land allocation to smallholders is required before research recommendations can be expected to work. ©1997ICIPE.},

Management decisions are analysed in terms of a theory of human problem-solving in order to show that decision rules may provide a basis for developing formal management techniques more appropriate to smallholder agriculture.

Efforts to reverse the downward trend must consider curriculum changes, which broaden the currently narrow and shrinking sources and catchment areas of potential fresh student intakes, as well as providing them with skills for lifelong learning and employment opportunities beyond the agricultural sector. This article examines some of the current perceptions and trends in AE education, and proposes a global orientation to a curriculum that equips undergraduate students with integrative skills in applied sciences, engineering principles and emerging technologies. A triad of emerging technological innovations that are driving the knowledge economy is identified and recommended for inclusion in an AE educational curriculum. The new AE education paradigm will enable graduates and professionals to shift the historical emphasis from 'on-farm mechanization' to the development and application of new innovations to support knowledge-intensive and information-driven agriculture. Effective communication and dialogue with key stakeholders, and implementing adequate response to emerging technological, environmental and economic challenges facing agriculture are critical to winning public support and improving the appeal of AE among school leavers and industries. Strategies that include changing the current name of educational AE programmes and/or professional societies must be pursued with considerable caution if the profession is to remain truly global and to facilitate the international mobility of future agricultural engineers in an increasingly globalized labour market.

	abstract = {A study conducted in three Tanzanian Districts in 2000 focused attention on stakeholders who have leadership, administrative, and various technical and development roles in relation to smallholders and cashew production. These stakeholders to a large extent shared the same perception of why and how sulphur fungicide must be used to ensure cashew production in the face of a perceived disease threat from powdery mildew disease (Oidium anacardii Noack). A standardised sulphur-based strategy for control of this serious disease was strongly favoured by the shared understanding, and by a coalition of organisational and financial resources of influential stakeholders. Major efforts to promote alternative knowledge and understanding about powdery mildew disease and its integrated control have, to a disturbing extent, not reached either the majority of producers or other stakeholders. Important factors limiting access to this knowledge were: poor integration of the knowledge and other resource networks of farmers and key non-farming stakeholders with official sources of alternative cashew crop protection and IPM information; ambiguity amongst researchers and development practitioners concerning the potential of IPM in cashew; deficient communication methods; and limited ideas on how to promote the active learning required for IPM. Researchers' understanding of the potential for IPM in cashew can be enriched through study of those farmers who have begun to practice their own local forms of IPM. Ways to enhance wider communication and testing of IPM concepts are suggested. These measures can help the emergence of a stronger consensus within the research establishment, and amongst intermediary and end-users of powdery mildew disease control information, for more vigorous development, promotion and use of IPM strategies in cashew powdery mildew control. © 2003 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

The aim of the study has been to analyse processes of mutual social change and acculturation resulting from the confrontation of the Moshav with various population types. For this purpose, the economic, social, ideological and organizational norms and conditions of the Moshav are first examined in detail, and then related to relevant characteristics of the different settler groups. These characteristics are spelled out in three broad factors. A. The basic socio‐cultural predispositions of the settlers, embedded in the nature of the family, the economy, the society, the polity, and the values of the country of origin. In order to classify the settlers in respect to these characteristics, and to predict their adjustment to the Moshav, a modified concept of the traditional‐modern continuum is employed. B. Socio‐dynamic predispositions, cutting across this continuum and determining the ability to change. Here attention is paid to such factors as stability of primary groups, security of status, and structure of leadership elite in the communities of origin. C. Cultural‐dynamic predispositions – chiefly the power of analytical thinking, generalisation and abstraction – affecting learning ability and the capacity for understanding new social situations. Finally, the settlement process itself is considered, as regards such factors as selection of settlers, communication, rate of development, etc. Cet article fournit les bases et le cadre théorique d'une étude menée en Israel sur les villages coopératifs de petits exploitants récemment immigrés (Moshavim). Le but de l'étude a été l'analyse du processus de changement social réciproque et de l'acculturation résultant de la réaction vis à vis du Moshav des divers types de population. Dans cet objectif, les normes économiques sociales, idéologiques et organisationnelles et autres caractéristiques de Moshav sont d'abord examinées en détail et ensuite rapportées aux caractères pertinents des divers groupes de colons. Ces caractéristiques sont exprimées en fonction de trois facteurs: A. Les prédispositions fondamentales des colons au point de vue socio‐culturel contenu dans la nature familiale, l'économie, la société, la politique et les valeurs du pays d'origine. De manière à classer les colons en regard de ces caractéristiques et à prévoir leur ajustement au Moshav, un concept modifié du continuum »traditionnel‐moderne« est employé. B. Les prédispositions socio‐dynamiques intervenant dans le continuum et déterminant l'aptitude au changement. Ici l'attention est attirée sur des facteurs tels que la stabilité des groupes primaires, sécurité des statuts et structure de l'élite dirigeante dans les communautés d'origine. C. Prédispositions dans le domaine culturel, principalement la capacité d'analyse, de généralisation et d'abstraction influençant l'aptitude à apprendre et la compréhension des situations sociales nouvelles. Enfin le processus de colonisation en lui‐même est envisagé en fonction des facteurs tels que sélection des colons, communication, taux de croissance, etc. Der vorliegende Beitrag befaßt sich mit dem Hintergrund und dem theoretischen Rahmen einer Untersuchung, die in Israel in kleinbäuerlichen Genossenschaftsdörfern mit Neueinwanderern(Moshavim) durchgeführt wurde. Das Ziel der Studie war, den Prozeß des wechselseitigen sozialen Wandels und der Akkulturation als Ergebnis der Gegen‐überstellung des Moshav mit verschiedenen Bevölkerungstypen zu analysieren. Zu diesem Zweck werden zunächst die ökonomischen, sozialen, ideologischen und institutionellen Normen und Verhaältnisse des Moshav im einzelnen untersucht und dann zu relevanten Merkmalen verschiedener Siedlergruppen in Beziehung gesetzet. Diese Merkmale gliedern sich in drei große Faktorengruppen: A. Die sozio‐kulturellen Grundanschauungen der Siedler, die sich aus dem Wesen von Familie, Wirtschaft, Gesellschaft, Verfassung und den Wertvorstellungen im Ursprungsland ergeben. Um die Siedler im Hinblick auf diese Merkmale einzuordnen und ihre Anpassungsfähigkeit an das Moshav zu beurteilen, wird ein modinziertes Konzept des Kontinuums “traditional‐modern” verwendet. B. Die sozio‐dynamischcn Anlagen, die über dieses Kontinuum hinweg die Fähigkeit zum Wandel bestimmen. Dabei werden Faktoren, wie Stabilität von Primärgruppen, Sicherheit des Status und Struktur der Elite in den Herkunftsgemeinden beräcksichtigt. C. Kulturell‐dynamische Eigenschaften – besonders die Fähigkeit, zum analytischen Denken, zur Verallgemeinerung und Abstraktion –, die die Fähigkeit zum Lernen und zum Verstehen neuer sozialer Situationen beeinflussen. Schließlich wird der Siedlungs‐prozeß selbst beobachtet, soweit es Faktoren wie Auswahl der Siedler, Kommunikation, Entwicklungsgrad usw, betrifft. Copyright © 1964, Wiley Blackwell.

	abstract = {Smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa face multiple trade-offs when deciding on the allocation of their financial, labour and nutrient resources. Day-to-day decisions have implications for the sustainability of their farming system, implying multiple trade-offs between short- and long-term objectives that have biophysical and socio-economic dimensions. We show that inverse modelling techniques can be used effectively for optimisation and trade-offs analysis of farming systems. By combining the multi-objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis algorithm and a crop/soil dynamic simulation model we were able to select farming strategies that resulted in the best possible trade-offs between different farming objectives. This integrated analytical tool allows optimisation of farmers' goals similar to linear programming, but an advantage over linear programming is that the proposed method takes into account a wider spectrum of biophysical processes including their interactions and feedbacks. Tradeoffs between resource productivity, use efficiency and conservation in relation to different patterns of resource allocation were analysed for a maize-based, simplified case study farm from western Kenya (2.2 ha - comprising fields of poor, medium and high soil fertility), under three scenarios of financial liquidity to invest in labour and inputs (2000, 5000 and 10,000 KSh ha-1; 75 KSh = 1 US\$). The maximum farm-scale maize production achieved was larger when financial resources increased. However, increasing maize yields above a certain threshold by applying mineral fertilisers was associated with larger N losses by leaching, runoff and soil erosion; such threshold was 2.7 t grain ha-1 for the scenario of no financial limitations (10,000 KSh ha-1). N losses at farm scale fluctuated between 36 and 54 kg N ha-1 season-1, while the maximum maize yields achieved were around 3.4 t grain ha-1. Soil losses by erosion increased abruptly beyond a certain maize yield (e.g. 1.8 t grain ha-1 for the 2000 KSh ha-1 scenario), while the minimum rate of soil loss differed between financial scenarios. Investments in hiring labour were prioritised over fertiliser use to obtain the greatest yields and the allocation of available resources favoured the more fertile fields. This inverse modelling exercise allowed us to analyse trade-offs between different farmers' objectives and to compare potential resource allocation strategies to achieve them. The set of strategies to achieve different goals was more numerous and variable when the conditions were less conducive for farming. This questions the validity of the prevailing model of extension/communication, based on generalised recommendations for resource-poor farmers in Africa. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study demonstrates the potential value of forecasts to smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe, the majority of whom often suffer severely from the impact of drought. Using crop simulation models to compare yield performances of farmers with and without forecasts, results indicate that, for a drought year, farmers with forecasts (WF) record higher yield gains (28\%) compared to those without forecasts (WOF): in particular, farmers located in the most arid regions (NR V) recorded the highest yield gains (42\%). A similar trend is observed during a neutral/average year, as farmers WF obtain predominantly higher yield gains (20\%) than those WOF. However, during a good year, results show a different pattern as no yield gains are observed. In fact, farmers WOF perform better, suggesting forecasts in this case may not make much difference. Using gross margin analysis, results show farmers WF obtaining higher returns during a drought (US\$0.14 ha-1) and neutral year (US\$0.43 ha-1) but again not for a good year as farmers WOF outperform those WF. To summarize, forecasts can play an important role as loss-minimization instruments especially if the underlying year is an El Niño (drought) year. In conclusion, to attain full economic value of forecasts, complementary policies (currently missing) such as effective communication, improvement in forecast extension skills and promotion of farmer participatory and outreach activities could prove vital in enhancing the value of forecasts to smallholder farmers in general. © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Analysis of the reasons why cooperatives were originally established in various parts of the world suggests that most of the causes (such as poverty, market failure and high transaction costs) also apply to the study farmers, as do the seven international principles of cooperation. Smallholder farmers in both case study regions have the potential to grow high-value crops such as vegetables, fruit and cut flowers.

	abstract = {In the Philippines, only a few farmers and plantation owners register their tree farms with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the office in charge of tree registration. One of the major reasons is their lack of knowledge of government policy on tree registration. To help improve the flow of information and understanding of tree registration policies among smallholder tree farmers and other stakeholders, a Primer on Tree Registration, Harvesting, Transport and Marketing Policies on Private Land was developed. Produced through the participation of stakeholders, including tree farmers, the DENR, and local government officers, police, and timber dealers, the Primer is highly visual and has been released in English as well as Waray-Waray and Cebuano dialects. This paper reports findings of focus group discussions conducted to gauge user reactions to the Primer. The Primer was considered as a valuable source of information about tree registration policies. Aside from being comprehensible, FGD participants found it attractive, perceived it to be intended for them and free from content that confused them. However, farmers suggested that illustrations need to be improved by making the persons portrayed more presentable and reflective of their actual tree farm operations. Participants said that aside from the Primer, the flow of information on tree registration policies could be improved through the use of multi-media including posters, radio broadcasts, and presentation in seminars for farmers. © 2009 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

	abstract = {This study explored whether technology adoption and changes in management practices were associated with farm structure, household, and farmer characteristics and to identify processes that may foster productivity and sustainability of small-scale dairy farming in the central highlands of Mexico. Factor analysis of survey data from 44 smallholders identified three factors—related to farm size, farmer’s engagement, and household structure—that explained 70 \% of cumulative variance. The subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis yielded three clusters. Cluster 1 included the most senior farmers with fewest years of education but greatest years of experience. Cluster 2 included farmers who reported access to extension, cooperative services, and more management changes. Cluster 2 obtained 25 and 35 \% more milk than farmers in clusters 1 and 3, respectively. Cluster 3 included the youngest farmers, with most years of education and greatest availability of family labor. Access to a network and membership in a community of peers appeared as important contributors to success. Smallholders gravitated towards easy to implement technologies that have immediate benefits. Nonusers of high investment technologies found them unaffordable because of cost, insufficient farm size, and lack of knowledge or reliable electricity. Multivariate analysis may be a useful tool in planning extension activities and organizing channels of communication to effectively target farmers with varying needs, constraints, and motivations for change and in identifying farmers who may exemplify models of change for others who manage farms that are structurally similar but performing at a lower level.},

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {A considerable percentage of Polish children from agricultural families are engaged by their parents in performing work activities on farms. The performance of these tasks arouses various emotional reactions in children, from the feeling of threat, fear and anxiety, to the feeling of satisfaction, being contented and proud. The subjective feeling of happiness and life satisfaction is an extremely important factor affecting the mental health and functioning of a human being. The objective of the study was to show to what extent the quality of communication between children and parents, and the level of family cohesion and adaptability according to the Circumplex Model by D. H. Olson et al., modifies children's emotional reactions associated with the tasks performed. The study covered 192 children aged 12-13, whose parents were running a family farm. Growing up in a healthy family characterised by a balanced level of cohesion, adaptability and good communication with the father and mother, favours the occurrence in children of pleasant emotions in reaction to work which they undertake on behalf of their parents on a farm. In such families, more often than in families with bad communication and dysfunctional families (disengaged, rigid), children experience satisfaction, have a feeling of deepening bonds with their parents, and the feeling of being more adult and preparing themselves well for adult life. Family characteristics which are evidence of disorders in its functioning (lack of good communication with the father, mother, lack of bonds between family members, rigid, chaos in a family) co-occur with the child experiencing unpleasant emotional states in associated with the work performed, there occur feelings of dissatisfaction, unhappiness, unpleasantness, the feeling that it would be better to learn than to work.},

@article{delgado_determinants_2008-1,
	title = {Determinants and implications of the growing scale of livestock farms in four fast-growing developing countries},
	abstract = {The research underlying this report investigated factors affecting the scaling-up of selected livestock products in Brazil, India, the Philippines, and Thailand, with particular attention directed at understanding issues affecting small-scale producers. Scaling-up is defined here as growth in the average size of farm in terms of annual livestock sales. The urgency of the topic is driven by the fact that livestock are among the few commodities that smallholder farmers widely produce that are growing rapidly in demand, and thus the interest for poverty alleviation is strong. However, there are signs that smallholders may ultimately be displaced from this source of livelihood by competition from larger-scale farms. Furthermore, the rapid growth in production of pigs and poultry has also been associated with significant environmental problems in the zones of most rapid growth. The interactions between overall growth in production, size of farms, and sustainability are crucial to rural poverty alleviation in a sustainable manner. Therefore, the objectives of the research were to assess whether the market share of large farms is growing relative to small farins and, if so, why. The analysis is directed primarily toward the issues of efficiency in production and its determinants, but also deals with the unit costs of inputs received and the unit prices for outputs obtained. The study specifically does not investigate the likely existence of economies of scale in output marketing, which are anecdotally thought to be large and will over time largely work to the disadvantage of independent (nonintegrated) farmers, especially small-scale ones. This important topic is deferred to a different study on contract farming in poultry and dairy using different data and approaches. The research was pursued by setting up models and collecting farm-level data to test the following hypotheses: • Small-scale producers have profits per unit of output that are higher than or equal to those of large producers. • Small-scale producers are more efficient users of farm resources to secure profits than are large producers, other things equal. • Small farmers expend a greater amount of effort or investment in abatement of negative environmental externalities per unit of output than do large farmers. • Uncompensated negative environmental externalities favor the nominal profit efficiency of large farms over small ones, ceteris paribus. • Profits of small producers are more sensitive to "transaction costs" than are those of large-scale producers. • Contract farmers are more profit-efficient than independent farmers at comparable scales of operation. Chapter 2 looks at evidence of growth and concentration of the livestock sector and establishes that scaling-up in livestock production is in fact occurring in all four countries studied. It suggests that production in the 1980s and 1990s tended to concentrate around capital cities and other major demand centers with the exception of Brazil. Since the late 1990s, larger-scale farms have been increasingly locating in remoter areas farther away from population centers, disease, and environmental challenges. Smallholder output continues to grow at high rates in certain cases, such as that of dairy farmers in India and swine producers in the Philippines, but the output from large-scale enterprises is growing even more rapidly, taking market share away from smallholders. This is particularly relevant in Brazil and Thailand, where there are relatively small numbers of small-scale producers left in the broiler business and the role of smallholders in both dairy farming and swine production is shrinking in relative terms. The question, then, is whether large-scale livestock production will outcompete that of smallholder producers everywhere and eventually provoke their exit from the sector. To analyze the scaling-up of livestock production, Chapter 3 defines a quantitative measure of relative farm competitiveness in production based on the use of stochastic profit frontiers estimated for each country and commodity, with technical inefficiency effects included, following the approach of Battese and Coelli (1995). It looks at factors that differ across farms that might explain higher relative competitiveness of specific farms. These factors include the usual determinants of profit efficiency, such as prices faced by the farm and fixed farm resources not traded in markets, asymmetries in access to assets (credit, liquidity, fixed capital) and information (education, experience, communication facilities), externalities (some farmers get away with uncompensated pollution, while others do not), and policies (some get a better deal from the state than do others). Chapter 4 describes field surveys that were conducted on cross-sections of farms of different sizes (small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale or commercial) and type of production arrangement (independent and contract). Chapter 5 summarizes the descriptive results of the survey and seeks to establish through descriptive statistics scale-related differences in farm-specific transaction costs, such as access to information and input and output markets, to direct further analytical work on explaining farm profit per unit of output. Results show that small-scale producers across the countries studied are characterized by small landholdings, low levels of education, few years of experience in livestock production, moderate use of inputs, and limited access to input and output markets. Large-scale farm households, therefore, may have a better chance of overcoming high transaction costs than do small-scale producers. On the other hand, smallholders have a chance to compete with larger-scale producers if they can cost family labor at less than the full opportunity cost of hired labor doing the same tasks on larger farms, perhaps because much of the labor on small farms consists of extra tasks performed by women or children who are at home for other reasons. The study does not claim that the opportunity cost of family labor is zero, but it repeats the relevant calculations with family labor costed either at full market wage rates or not at all, with the correct answer postulated to fall somewhere in the resulting range between the two. Chapter 6 first discusses the likely impact of scaling-up of livestock production on the environment, then investigates the issue of whether large-scale sample farms make less of an effort per unit of output to mitigate pollution through expenditures on lagoons, manure spreading on farm land, and other mitigation activities than do small-scale sample farms in the study countries. If so, by hypothesis they would be polluting more per unit of output than are small farms, assuming that each unit of output produces the same effluent regardless of production system. Results show that across countries and commodities, small-scale farms have higher environmental mitigation "expenditures" per unit of output than large-scale farms. The exceptions are poultry farmers in Thailand, where large-scale operations in the densely settled export-certified zone spend more per unit than smaller farms, and dairy farmers in Thailand, where the larger-scale farmers have more crop land per animal than do the smaller-scale farmers in the sample. Results are backed up by a second, more conventional procedure that estimates mass balances of nutrients per hectare added to farm soils on different farms. Again, it is shown that large farms load more excess nutrients per hectare of land than do small farms, suggesting that in fact large farms benefit from a higher uncompensated environmental externality per unit of output than do small farms, giving them a distorted cost advantage. Chapter 7 reports the econometric evidence from stochastic profit frontier analysis using the Battese-Coelli (1995) approach to technical inefficiencies on why some farms are relatively more profit-efficient than others at making farm profits from livestock. Chapter 8 then ties these results together with the preceding descriptive analysis. The main findings are as follows: • Independent small farms in India and the Philippines typically have higher profits per unit than do independent large farms, but this is not the case for large and small contract farms. On the other hand, large independent farms are relatively more profit-efficient than small independents almost everywhere, suggesting that over time they will continue to outcompete smallholders and gain further market share. India, where most farms are small and dairy dominates, is a notable exception. • In Brazil and Thailand in particular, where scaling-up has already occurred to a large extent in monogastrics, the outlook for independent smallholder producers of the items studied is not rosy. In the Philippines, there is considerable scope on economic grounds for the improvement of smallholder fanning through vertical coordination of those farms that are presently a little larger than the bottom 20 percent of the size distribution of farms, especially for swine producers. • Small farms have less of a negative impact on the environment than do large farms. Hence, environmental concerns are compatible with promoting small-scale livestock production. Large farms that are more environmentally responsible are also more competitive within the class of large farms (particularly Philippine broiler and swine farms). Efficient large-scale production is compatible with good environmental behavior, although it seems likely that both are correlated with some third factor, such as the chicken and swine inventory held on-farm or the ability to sell manure produced on-farm.},

The relationship between agriculture and biodiversity has been subjected to recent questionings, both in society and in the realm of public policies, as a result of growing concerns about the environmental changes caused by anthropic action. However, despite the increase in the number of studies on family-based agriculture, and on biodiversity in Brazil, the research funding available for researching the relationship between those two broad themes is still incipient. Against this backdrop, we shall pursue two main objectives with this study: (1) to investigate how the role of family-based agriculture in the preservation of biodiversity has been approached by the social sciences in Brazil, with a focus on articles published in Brazilian scientific journals over the last 20 years that are available online; (2) to elaborate an inventory of the knowledge available on this issue in order to test a methodology for a comprehensive literature review to help decision-makers involved with public policies as it is suggested by the evidence-based policy approach. © 2011 Interdisciplinary Centre for Comparative Research in the Social Sciences and ICCR Foundation.},

	volume = {98},
	doi = {10.1016/j.smallrumres.2011.03.035},
	abstract = {Many smallholder breeding programs in developing countries failed because of neglecting basic conditions, particularly the no involvement of farmers in a participatory manner from design to the implementation phase of the programs. Inadequate centralized breeding plans to improve local breeds and various plans prescribing crossbreeding with European highly producing breeds, failed. Though some nucleus breeding programs were successful and attained some sustainability if the farmers' participation was considered, they still are vulnerable once the funding provided ends. An evolving approach, emerging from participatory research experiences, involves community-based breeding programs for smallholder farmers in low-input systems. These are being implemented in pilot research sites with promising results and already rendering lessons learned that merit consideration in relation with the sustainability of a program. The paper discusses important factors for the success of these programs. Farmers' participation along with main issues for program implementation are highlighted in relation to site selection, the communication processes, recording schemes, role of scientists, the institutionalisation of cooperation and the enabling environment. Finally, ongoing case studies of successful community-based breeding programs are mentioned. Shortcomings in farmers' participation require attention and institutional strengthening for effective application of participatory tools and knowledge exchange between farmers and researchers. But participatory research alone is not the sole prescription for success. No matter how participatory the plans will be, they will always depend on technical support and institutional support for data collection, analysis and feedback. This is hindered because of the short-term projection of funding for research projects. An important issue relates to the out scaling of successful experiences at project level that benefits only a limited number of farmers. The only avenue to guarantee sustainability is that government priorities (local or national) emphasize community-based breeding as a viable alternative for smallholder improvement on a long-term basis, and development and appropriate policies provide the enabling environment for realization and adoption at a large scale. Under these conditions research will have an advisory and facilitating role whereas ownership of the program will go to the community-level. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {As the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is embraced in Uganda, determinants of awareness of ICT based projects remain unknown. The intensity of use of mobile phones among smallholder farmers in the areas where such projects operate is unclear. To address this knowledge gap, 346 smallholder farmers in two ICT project sites in Mayuge and Apac districts were subjected to econometric analysis using bi-variate logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models to ascertain determinants of projects' awareness and intensity of use of mobile phones. The authors find that education, distance to input markets, and membership in a group positively influence awareness. The decision to use a mobile phone for agricultural purposes is affected by distance to electricity and land cultivated and negatively influenced by being a member of any farmer group. Lastly, intensity of mobile phone use is affected by age, farming as the major occupation, and distance to an internet facility, being a member of a project, having participated in an agricultural project before, value of assets, size of land cultivated, possession of a mobile phone, and proximity to agricultural offices. The paper discusses policy implications of these findings.},

	abstract = {In this article, the effectiveness of a multimedia extension program targeted at Honduran farmers who have low human capital investments and whose traditional farming methods are being threatened by radical changes in their resource bases are analysed. Dichotomous, yes or no decisions were examined in a binary logistic regression. Farmers were asked to identify their sources of learning. Institutional and human capital variables were included to diminish other forms of bias and to identify which groups of farmers are amenable to adopting new technologies. An extension program for a region in Honduras was analysed to determine what types of farmers are responsive to new technologies and what types of training promote the adoption of those technologies. Producers of commercial crops demonstrated an increasing inclination to adopt new technologies as they increased the market proportion of their output. Subsistence farmers demonstrated a negative correlation between land extensiveness and technology adoption. Cooperative association had a positive influence on adoption. The results indicate that training and visitation extension methods have a multiplier effect through personal contacts of experts and friends and are very effective in motivating technology adoption. Mass communication media cannot be discounted and present a viable alternative. -from Authors},

	doi = {10.1007/s10584-012-0500-y},
	abstract = {Policy measures regarding adaptation to climate change include efforts to adjust socio-economic and ecologic systems. Colombia has undertaken various measures in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation since becoming a party of the Kyoto protocol in 2001 and a party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. The first national communication to the UNFCCC stated how Colombian agriculture will be severely impacted under different emission scenarios and time frames. The analyses in this document further support that climate change will severely threaten the socioeconomics of Colombian agriculture. We first query national data sources to characterize the agricultural sector. We then use 17 Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural production may be affected by climate change, and show the expected changes to years 2040-2069 ("2050") under the A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A2) and the overall trends in both precipitation and temperature to 2100. We then evaluate expected changes within different regions and measure the proportion of area affected within each crop's distributional range. By 2050, climatic change in Colombia will likely impact 3. 5 million people, 14 \% of national GDP corresponding to agriculture, employment of 21 \% of the population, agro-industries, supply chains, and food and nutritional security. If no adaptation measures are taken, 80 \% of crops would be impacted in more than 60 \% of their current areas of cultivation, with particularly severe impacts in high value perennial and exportable crops. Impacts also include soil degradation and organic matter losses in the Andes hillsides; likely flooding in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts; niche losses for coffee, fruit, cocoa, and bananas; changes in prevalence of pests and diseases; and increases in the vulnerabilities of non-technically developed smallholders. There is, however, still time to change the current levels of vulnerability if a multidisciplinary focus (i. e., agronomic, economic, and social) in vulnerable sectors is undertaken. Each sub-sector and the Government need to invest in: (1) data collection, (2) detailed, regionally-based impact assessments, (3) research and development, and (4) extension and technology transfer. Support to vulnerable smallholders should be given by the state in the form of agricultural insurance systems contextualized under the phenomenon of climate change. A national coordination scheme led by (but not restricted to) the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) with the contributions of national and international institutions is needed to address agricultural adaptation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: The Nutrition Embedded Evaluation Programme Impact Evaluation (NEEP-IE) study is a cluster randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of a childcare centre-based integrated nutritional and agricultural intervention on the diets, nutrition and development of young children in Malawi. The intervention includes activities to improve nutritious food production and training/behaviour-change communication to improve food intake, care and hygiene practices. This paper presents the rationale and study design for this randomised control trial. Methods: Sixty community-based childcare centres (CBCCs) in rural communities around Zomba district, Malawi, were randomised to either (1) a control group where children were attending CBCCs supported by Save the Children's Early Childhood Health and Development (ECD) programme, or (2) an intervention group where nutritional and agricultural support activities were provided alongside the routine provision of the Save the Children's ECD programme. Primary outcomes at child level include dietary intake (measured through 24-h recall), whilst secondary outcomes include child development (Malawi Development Assessment Tool (MDAT)) and nutritional status (anthropometric measurements). At household level, primary outcomes include smallholder farmer production output and crop-mix (recall of last production season). Intermediate outcomes along theorised agricultural and nutritional pathways were measured. During this trial, we will follow a mixed-methods approach and undertake child-, household-, CBCC- and market-level surveys and assessments as well as in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with project stakeholders. Discussion: Assessing the simultaneous impact of preschool meals on diets, nutrition, child development and agriculture is a complex undertaking. This study is the first to explicitly examine, from a food systems perspective, the impact of a preschool meals programme on dietary choices, alongside outcomes in the nutritional, child development and agricultural domains. The findings of this evaluation will provide evidence to support policymakers in the scale-up of national programmes.},

	abstract = {This article investigates how a one-to-one support process based on the use of a whole dairy farm simulation tool helps both farmers to reflect on their production strategies and researchers to better understand the farmers' contexts of action and decision. The support process consists of a minimum of four discussion sessions with the farmer: designing the Initial Scenario and formulating a diagnosis, building and simulating the Project Scenario corresponding to the objective targeted by the farmer, building and comparing alternative scenarios proposed both by the farmer and the researcher, and evaluating the process with the farmer. The approach was tested with six smallholder farmers in Brazil. It is illustrated with the example of one farmer who aimed to develop his milk production by more than doubling his herd size on the same cultivated area. Two other examples illustrate the diversity of issues addressed with this approach. The first estimates the sensitivity of economic results to price variations of milk and concentrates. The second compares two scenarios in terms of forage supply autonomy. The discussion assesses the outcomes of the approach for farmers in terms of response to their specific issues and of knowledge acquired. The research outputs are discussed in terms of the value and limits of using simulation tools within both participatory action research and advisory processes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Many smallholders in Nepal rely on marginal lands that are subject to declining fertility due in part to traditional farming practices. The adoption of conservation agriculture practices has the potential to improve livelihoods and food security but depends on knowledge sharing among farmers, extension agents, and researchers. This study uses Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine farmer, extension professional, and researcher preferences for selected conservation agriculture production systems (CAPS) and a widely-practiced traditional production system. This data is then used to determine which CAPS have the highest likelihood of adoption and identify misunderstandings or knowledge gaps among farmers, extension personnel and scientists. AHP was conducted in three tribal villages and at two NGOs that provide research and extension services to smallholders in the central Middle Hills region of Nepal. Overall, soil quality was identified as the most important factor affecting long-term household income, the primary motivator of adoption in study villages. Farmers generally preferred full tillage followed by cowpea solo crop in the second growing season while extension agents and researchers preferred strip tillage followed by cowpea and millet intercrop in the second season. Results indicate that (1) stakeholders prefer CAPS over traditional systems, (2) farmers prefer full tillage over minimum tillage and (3) the farmers in the village of Khola Gaun may be more prepared to adopt minimum tillage and intercropping than the other villages. Communication among all stakeholders should be improved and the results of on-farm plots should be used to reinforce understanding of CAPS benefits. It should be kept in mind that labor savings is not a main motivator of adoption among village farmers and further research should be conducted in Khola Gaun to learn why farmer preferences there differ significantly from farmer preferences in other villages. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Small-holder farmers in Ethiopia are facing several climate related hazards, in particular highly variable rainfall with severe droughts which can have devastating effects on their livelihoods. Projected changes in climate are expected to aggravate the existing challenges. This study examines farmer perceptions on current climate variability and long-term changes, current adaptive strategies, and potential barriers for successful further adaptation in two case study regions - the Central Rift Valley (CRV) and Kobo Valley. The study was based on a household questionnaire, interviews with key stakeholders, and focus group discussions. The result revealed that about 99 \% of the respondents at the CRV and 96 \% at the Kobo Valley perceived an increase in temperature and 94 \% at CRV and 91 \% at the Kobo Valley perceived a decrease in rainfall over the last 20-30 years. Inter-annual and intraseasonal rainfall variability also has increased according to the farmers. The observed climate data (1977-2009) also showed an increasing trend in temperature and high inter-annual and intra-seasonal rainfall variability. In contrast to farmers' perceptions of a decrease in rainfall totals, observed rainfall data showed no statistically significant decline. The interaction among various bio-physical and socio-economic factors, changes in rainfall intensity and reduced water available to crops due to increased hot spells, may have influenced the perception of farmers with respect to rainfall trends. In recent decades, farmers in both the CRV and Kobo have changed farming practices to adapt to perceived climate change and variability, for example, through crop and variety choice, adjustment of cropping calendar, and in situ moisture conservation. These relatively low-cost changes in farm practices were within the limited adaptation capacity of farmers, which may be insufficient to deal with the impacts of future climate change. Anticipated climate change is expected to impose new risks outside the range of current experiences. To enable farmers to adapt to these impacts critical technological, institutional, and market-access constraints need to be removed. Inconsistencies between farmers' perceptions and observed climate trends (e.g., decrease in annual rainfall) could lead to sub-optimal or counterproductive adaptations, and therefore must be removed by better communication and capacity building, for example through Climate Field Schools. Enabling strategies, which are among others targeted at agricultural inputs, credit supply, market access, and strengthening of local knowledge and information services need to become integral part of government policies to assist farmers to adapt to the impacts of current and future climate change. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the challenges and opportunities entailed in the design, implementation and dissemination of an interdisciplinary project that evolved into a knowledge co-production effort. The project explored the livelihood strategies of coffee growers in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica facing multiple stressors of economic (market shocks and price volatility) and physical nature (climate variability and pest incidence). Our objective was to determine the factors that influence farmers' decisions and the implications of those decisions for the people and the landscapes of the region. To achieve this objective, we intended to engage farm communities and sector representatives in the research process, and to a large extent this intent was realized. Nevertheless, the project illustrates the difficulties in achieving knowledge "co-production" with stakeholders whose day-to-day existence focuses on issues largely outside the domain of the research program. We adopted decision-analysis tools to integrate our knowledge and hypotheses to find a common language and structure for our research design. In relation to regional and national policy makers and sector experts, we aimed to communicate the decision-environment of the smallholder producer to enhance awareness of the institutional opportunities and constraints in the adaptation process. For the farmers themselves, we aimed to serve as conduits and mirrors of their own knowledge, rather than serving as external authorities on issues that appeared to be of little interest to them. Through the course of the project, we experimented with diverse modes of stakeholder interaction and, through collaboration with local experts in communication strategies, identified a set of tools for successful dissemination of results. The credibility and direct ties of the participating research organizations and collaborating institutes with the local communities were often an asset, sometimes a complication, but always a critical factor in the process of stakeholder interaction. The messages constructed from the collective knowledge of local farmers in distinct regions in four countries with different social and institutional histories represent crucial information for policy makers who are looking to support the adaptation processes of rural people facing changes of a global nature. However, communicating these messages in a usable and useful way to decision makers at various levels proved to be challenging. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Knowledge-based development interventions for improved natural resource management have long advocated for the integration of local and outsiders' knowledge. Participatory and conventional approaches frame this as a dialogue between "local" and "scientific" knowledges, using the relative strengths of each stakeholder's experience to reinforce knowledge gaps. While the epistemological and methodological challenges of such dialogue are well-documented, this study uses a community-based learning project for integrated soil fertility management in western Kenya to explore the less understood dynamics of dissonance between and within knowledge systems. While participatory research did build a dynamic expertise for soil fertility management shared by both smallholder farmers and scientists, divergent expectations and understandings emerged after the initial enthusiasm of shared learning. This included scientists assessing farmers as "not very good" researchers and farmers seeing researchers as "not very good" farmers. Dissonances between actors' different understandings of soil, the research process, and each other had multiple implications, including on the validity of conclusions reached by different actors and on the possibility for scientific support for local experimentation. While many dissonances ultimately fueled learning and improvements to the project, this required both farmers and scientists to move beyond initial critiques of each other's knowledge and practices. At their worst, dissonant knowledge claims were actually political ones, hiding competition for control of the development process. Recognizing the nature and extent of dissonances is therefore a crucial step in understanding how best to apply limited resources and disciplinary expertise within participatory teams attempting to build hybrid knowledge. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {During the last 10 yr, research on seasonal climate forecasts as an agricultural risk management tool has pursued three directions: modeling potential impacts and responses, identifying opportunities and constraints, and analyzing risk communication aspects. Most of these approaches tend to frame seasonal climate forecasts as a discrete product with direct and linear effects. In contrast, the authors propose that agricultural management is a performative process, constituted by a combination of planning, experimentation, and improvisation and drawing on a mix of technical expertise, situated knowledge, cumulative experience, and intuitive skill as farmers navigate a myriad of risks in the pursuit of livelihood goals and economic opportunities. This study draws on ethnographic interviews conducted with 38 family farmers in southern Georgia, examining their livelihood goals and social values, strategies for managing risk, and interactions with weather and climate information, specifically their responses to seasonal climate forecasts. Findings highlight the social nature of information processing and risk management, indicating that both material conditions and value based attitudes bear upon the ways farmers may integrate climate predictions into their agricultural management practices. These insights translate into specific recommendations that will enhance the salience, credibility, and legitimacy of seasonal climate forecasts among farmers and will promote the incorporation of such information into a skillful performance in the face of climate uncertainty. © 2010 American Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {Adapting to climate change is the most serious challenge facing our species. The scale is global, trajectory of onset uncertain and impacts potentially catastrophic (IPCC 2013). As further evidence emerges and as the scramble to adapt to the ‘new normal’ intensifies, persistent problems, past failures and new challenges have the potential to converge in a perfect storm. In response, extension and advisory service (EAS) providers have a key role to play as a critical link between farming populations and sources of new information and tools, so that practices can be appropriately adapted. This chapter outlines the challenge of adapting to climate change, identifies past and present points of EAS engagement, and proposes future responses, with a focus on the constraints and conditions of smallholder farmers in the tropics, and the natural resource base upon which agriculture depends.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Purpose: Approaches to build farmers' analytical capacities are said to trigger wide-ranging changes. This article reports on the communication process between participants and non-participants in one such approach, related to the technical and management skills learned by participants and the changes these participants subsequently made, and the outcomes in terms of non-participants' learning. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this study, we analysed the following: (1) participants' learning and changes in social practices; (2) communication between participants and non-participants regarding technical and management skills and changes in social practices; (3) non-participants' learning and changes in social practices. The case study was a management advice to family farm project in three villages in Benin. Findings: Most participants learned management skills, which led them to reassess their objectives and to reduce traditional social practices they now considered unproductive. Even in the case of frequent communication, non-participants found it difficult to learn management skills, which hindered their experiential learning. Non-participants consequently had difficulty understanding why participants changed their social practices such as reduction of their traditional gift giving, leading to limited well-argued discussion about these changes in practices between participants and non-participants. Practical Implications: This study shows that, due to the limited learning process of non-participants communicating with participants, there is a need to design and test approaches to achieve capacity-building while including more participants at a similar cost, and to stimulate explicit discussion at village level about the changes in values and social practices that these approaches may trigger. Originality/Value: The article analyses both participants and non-participants' experiential learning, and looks at the two sides of the interaction between the communication processes and non-participants' learning.},

Here, we describe a two-step, rapid response approach to the Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), an invasive noctuid pest newly causing havoc on maize production in Africa and Asia. First, we developed a science-based, animated video – now being localized further into various languages across Africa and Asia – intended to aid semi-literate, smallholder farmers in identifying and scouting for fall armyworm effectively. Second, we made the animation easily available for (re)distribution in affected areas via the Internet and copying/sharing with Bluetooth®, thereby exponentially increasing the animation’s reach across a wide spectrum of diverse languages and literacy levels. In this way, this form of asymmetrical communication hybridizes and combines the educational qualities of print dissemination with the range of radio/television delivery.},

	abstract = {Structured interviews were held with a representative sample of 171 Moshav (smallholder) farmers in Israel. Advisers of the official Extension Service, the publications of this service and farmers’ monthlies were considered to have contributed to farmers’ practical, agricultural knowledge more than the other communication channels. Among the activities of the Extensiom Service, personal farm visits by advisers were preferred. Next came other forms of indnvidual communication: farmers’ visits to the extension office and calls to the adviser’s horme. Group activities, like courses and group meetings in the village, were less frequented. The communication of agrotechnical information is much more common than advice on economic and organizational matters; yet the majority of farmers would like to receive more economic advice. Advisers had more contact with better educated farmers. All other demographic factors had no significant influence on the dependent variables. The Israeli findings were compared, where feasible, with studies made in the U.K., U.S A., Canada, Australia and Germany. When given the opportunity to mention peers and family as main source of information, this source came in first place in Australia, Canada and Germany. Israel was the only country reviewed, in which extension was the main source of information for farmers. In the U.K., in a U.S. and a Canadian study, the press took first rank. Television, and even more so radio, were not considered important sources of information. © 1991, Walter de Gruyter. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: There are many farmers in rural Ethiopia, who do not join cooperative societies, despite the different technical and financial supports from the government. This study thus aims to investigate the main factors that inspire rural people to join into the cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: The study collected relevant primary data from 400 sample households using a special household survey designed for this study. The study also reviewed different secondary materials. The collected data were analyzed using the two-sample t-test principle and cooperative participation probit model. Findings: The finding of the binary choice model illustrates that information access, special skill, membership in rural association, frequency of attending a public meeting/workshop, household head education, credit access, training access, number of family members in school, distance to main market, availability of infrastructures, farmland ownership and farmland sizes are the major explanatory variables that have statistically significant (p-value {\textless}0.05) influence on the rural people joining in the cooperative societies in the study areas. Research limitations/implications: This study was based on a cross-sectional survey. As a result, the finding may be subjected to some limitations though the study made all possible efforts to minimize the limitations. Practical implications: Many studies found that cooperatives are a basis for food security. Accordingly, the government can increase a number of cooperative societies in the region by giving more focus to knowledge- and awareness-based instruments like education, information center, rural associations, communication services and roads. These campaigns can attract more people to join the cooperatives and then get the different economic and social advantages from the cooperatives in order to ensure household food security. Originality/value: Some studies found that state, leadership, success history of the cooperative and autonomous status are the most important factors that determine not only the expansion of cooperatives in terms of a number of and types but also for the success of the cooperatives. This study, however, found the importance of information- and knowledge-based mechanisms as a basis to attract more people so that increase in a number of and types of the cooperative societies. Thus, the result of the study is significant for policy makers, social science students, researchers and cooperative societies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Widespread mobile phone ownership in Africa means that, for the first time, there is a realistic opportunity to deliver pertinent information to remote farmers throughout the continent. Efforts to harness the potential of mobile phones include the development of agricultural market information services (MIS) – applications that send farmers crop pricing information via short message service or SMS. These services promote economic development among some farmers in the developing world, but not yet in rural Kenya. To understand what factors impede the adoption of these services, we qualitatively studied Kenyan farmers’ mobile phone usage patterns and their interactions with MFarm, a commercially available MIS. Using affordance theory to guide our analysis, we discovered a mismatch between the design of MIS and smallholder farmers’ perceptions of their mobile phones’ communication capabilities. We use these findings to motivate a design agenda that encourages software developers and development practitioners to adopt an ecological perspective when creating mobile applications for sub-Saharan Africa's rural farmers. Strategies for implementing this approach include reconsidering the design of mobile phones, and developing innovative educational interventions.},

By using a new approach, called zooming-in zooming-out, the videos were of regional relevance and locally appropriate. When the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) introduced them to Africa in 2005, many scientists and civil servants thought that the videos would be culturally inappropriate and hence irrelevant to African smallholder farmers. However, African farmers whowatched the videos did not experience cultural barriers. In fact, they enjoyed seeing another part of the world where farmers faced similar problems as theirs, and were able to solve these problems by themselves. To promote wider uptake of the videos a key challenge was to overcome the institutional barriers. Public sector agencies especially had to be convinced that African smallholders appreciated Asian videos. By watching the videos with farmers and listening to their feedback, the skeptical scientists and service providers changed their minds. By 2009, the Bangladeshi rice seed videos had been translated into 20 African languages and so became national products. Videos made according to the zooming-in zooming-out approach can bring farmer-to-farmer extension to a higher level of social aggregation. © 2010 Wageningen University.},

The study found that the role of MPOB consists of information sharing on oil palm cultivation, technical assistance, advisory services and expertise, providing assistance with seeds, fertilizers and pesticides as well as marketing. The type of empowerment that has been built consists of the individual empowerment, technical, communication and marketing of the oil palm products.

	abstract = {This study is a qualitative survey of the effectiveness of communication between agricultural extension personnel and smallholder farmers in the Gweru district of Zimbabwe. Extension communication, particularly, has a large bearing on the sustainability of agricultural developments projects. The apparent lack of information, education and training during the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) of Zimbabwe contributed to low agricultural production and productivity which could consequently lead to continuing food insecurity in the country. The findings indicate a discrepancy between work experience and qualifications of the extension workers which could imply a lack in the quality of knowledge, information and skills imparted to the resettled farmers. Further findings indicate a lack of stakeholder analysis in designing agricultural communication projects and an absence of a multi-media communication approach to enhance adoption of agricultural innovations. The study concludes that agricultural extension is not adequate due to multiple resource constraints. The findings imply that agricultural communication should be integrative.

The aim of the 'Climate Outlooks and Agent-Based Simulation of Adaptation in South Africa' project has been to investigate whether individuals, who adapt gradually to annual climate variability, are better equipped to respond to longer-term climate variability and change in a sustainable manner. Seasonal climate outlooks provide information on expected annual rainfall and thus can be used to adjust seasonal agricultural strategies to respond to expected climate conditions. A case study of smallholder farmers in a village in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province, South Africa has been used to examine how such climate outlooks might influence agricultural strategies and how this climate information can be improved to be more useful to farmers. Empirical field data has been collected using surveys, participatory approaches and computer-based knowledge elicitation tools to investigate the drivers of decision-making with a focus on the role of climate, market and livelihood needs. This data is used in an agent-based social simulation which incorporates household agents with varying adaptation options which result in differing impacts on crop yields and thus food security, as a result of using or ignoring the seasonal outlook. Key variables are the skill of the forecast, the social communication of the forecast and the range of available household and community-based risk coping strategies.

The result show that usage of ISFM in the Chinyanja Triangle (Southern Africa) is grouped into 3 technological sets based on complementarities. The set of nutrient dense technologies of inorganic fertiliser, compost and animal manure (ISFMset3) indicates that they are used by farmers who face similar opportunities of having land that require minimal input, sell produce at farm gate as opposed to market, have more transport and communication facilities, and recover from livestock loss. Loss of crops, however, deter adoption of this set. The technological set comprising of fallow, rotation and grain legumes (ISFMset2) which enhances biomass accumulation and nitrogen fixation with complementary effects in cereal dominated farming system, is more likely adopted by households with land that require more inputs, are more educated, own more bicycles and have higher financial capital. Other four technologies (ISFMset1 including mulch, lime, compost and agroforestry) are used by a few individuals to address specific constraints in nutrient and water retention, and acidity. The result also indicated variations in usage of ISFMset3 between sites. These results are instrumental in identifying factors that influence adoption of a set of ISFM technologies in the Chinyanja Triangle and could be of use in targeting research and development initiatives.},

	abstract = {Smallholder irrigation schemes are largely supply driven such that they exclude the beneficiaries on the management decisions and the choice of the irrigation schemes that would best suit their local needs. It is against this background that the decentralisation framework and the Dublin Principles on Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) emphasise the need for a participatory approach to water management. The Zimbabwean government has gone a step further in decentralising the management of irrigation schemes, that is promoting farmer managed irrigation schemes so as to ensure effective management of scarce community based land and water resources. The study set to investigate the way in which the Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme is managed with specific emphasis on the role of the Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), the level of accountability and the powers devolved to the IMC. Merrey's 2008 critique of IWRM also informs this study which views irrigation as going beyond infrastructure by looking at how institutions and decision making processes play out at various levels including at the irrigation scheme level. The study was positioned on the hypothesis that 'decentralised or autonomous irrigation management enhances the sustainability and effectiveness of irrigation schemes'. To validate or falsify the stated hypothesis, data was gathered using desk research in the form of reviewing articles, documents from within the scheme and field research in the form of questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and field observation. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to analyse data quantitatively, whilst content analysis was utilised to analyse qualitative data whereby data was analysed thematically. Comparative analysis was carried out as Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme was compared with other smallholder irrigation scheme's experiences within Zimbabwe and the Sub Saharan African region at large. The findings were that whilst the scheme is a model of a decentralised entity whose importance lies at improving food security and employment creation within the community, it falls short in representing a downwardly accountable decentralised irrigation scheme. The scheme is faced with various challenges which include its operation which is below capacity utilisation, absence of specialised technical human personnel to address infrastructural breakdowns, uneven distribution of water pressure, incapacitated Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), absence of a locally legitimate constitution, compromised beneficiary participation and unclear lines of communication between various institutions involved in water management. Understanding decentralization is important since one of the key tenets of IWRM is stakeholder participation which the decentralization framework interrogates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40066-018-0200-6},
	abstract = {Background: Smallholder farmers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable to climate shocks but often lack access to agricultural insurance. Weather index insurance (WII) could reduce some of the problems associated with traditional, indemnity-based insurance programs, but uptake has been lower than expected. One reason is that WII contracts are not yet sufficiently tailored to the needs and preferences of smallholder farmers. This study combines survey and choice-experimental data from Kenya to analyze the experience with an existing WII program and how specific changes in the contractual design might encourage uptake. Results: Many smallholders struggle with fully understanding the functioning of the program, which undermines their confidence. Regular provision of relevant rainfall measurements and thresholds would significantly increase farmers' willingness to pay for WII. Mechanisms to reduce basis risk are also positively valued by farmers, although not to the same extent as higher levels of transparency. Finally, offering contracts to small groups rather than individual farmers could increase insurance uptake. Conclusions: Better training on WII and regular communication are needed. Group contracts may help to reduce transaction costs. Farmer groups can also be important platforms for learning about complex innovations, including novel risk transfer products. These concrete results are specific to Kenya; however, they provide some broader policy-relevant insights into typical issues of WII in a small-farm context.},

One major constraint is the lack of access to information and communications, which could be used to make decisions and reach new markets. In this paper, drawing from our experiences designing agricultural information systems in India and Central America, we provide a framework for understanding inter-stakeholder communications within agricultural value chains, focusing on the needs of small producers. First, we outline the major types of stakeholders - including farmers, consumers, intermediaries and various supporting organizations. Then, we survey the major categories of information systems supporting communication between stakeholders, focusing on those reaching small farmers. Based on this survey, we provide the following categorization of information flows within agricultural value chains: 1) Iink-to-Iink (L2L): those information flows required to coordinate the sale, movement, and distribution of produce along the value chain, 2) peer-to-peer (P2P): communications required to share knowledge and experiences between members of the same stakeholder group, and the expert community serving that stakeholder group and 3) end-toend (E2E): communications between producers and consumers, for example, to facilitate exchange of non-economic values to be used as external inputs to market pricing (e.g, certification). We outline some reasons why current information systems have had difficulty in reaching small producers, and highlight a few technology trends that could contribute to increasing the fidelity and accessibility of communications, both between producers and consumers, as well as within their respective stakeholder communities.},

It discusses the parallel knowledge pathways smallholder farmers' use to access conservation agriculture information. The objective of this study is to develop an effective dissemination model that exploits the use of ICTs in existing pathways in order to improve Conservation Agriculture knowledge flows. Design, Methodology and Approach: A total of one hundred and twenty-five respondents were interviewed, with a purposively selected sample of 110 CA farmers interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Using the snowball method, 15 key informant interviews were conducted with Policy makers and ICT service providers. 69\% of the respondents were female and 51\% male. The focus of the study was on the different ICTs used in the CA knowledge pathways, the dissemination pathways, institutional and socio-economic factors. Data was analyzed manually and using SSPS ver. 21. Preliminary findings indicate that a variety of knowledge pathways exist through which farmers can access CA knowledge. Four different kinds of ICT led models were identified, Government ICT led models, Government-NGO led models, Government-NGO-Private Sector ICT led model and NGO ICT led models. However the study notes a lack of harmonization and weak linkages between institutions in the utilization of the existing ICT models, utilization of the ICTs access and ownership at the household level and harmonization of the CA messages. Furthermore, even though there was 100\% mobile phones ownership, 94\% radio, 64\% television, 10\% Laptop and 9\% Computer (desktop) access and ownership among the respondents, farmers and a large number of the extension staff lacked the skills to fully exploit the use of these tools to access CA knowledge. Implication: New emerging and existing communication technologies have a very high potential to improve agricultural knowledge flows if taken advantage of by the "change agents" in the diffusion process of new innovations. New online technologies known as Web 2.0 and 'social media' are slowly emerging as platforms for collaboration, sharing of product and market information. Open chain models of village information centres also provide numerous economic opportunities, and do also network communities while providing public/private services. The opportunity of using real time communication tools has been greatly embraced especially by the youthful farmers and the advantage of these new emerging tools is their unique attributes, similar to the traditional oral cultures of communication seen in the African social systems where one can see, hold a discussion, get immediate feedback and use the written media to convey messages. The high percentage of ownership and accessibility of ICTs among the survey population also offers the potential to fully exploit ICTs in the improvement of the CA knowledge pathways and agricultural information provision.},

	abstract = {Food security and poverty remain aggravating challenges in East Africa despite decades of development work and research. Enhancing food security having complex dimensions of food availability, food accessibility, food stability and food utilisation, requires an integrated approach that transcends disciplinary boundaries and aims at solving real world problems not solely at contributing scientific knowledge. Horticulture, in particular, African Indigenous Vegetables (AIVs) provide a comparatively advantageous entry point as they offer largely untapped potentials in terms of workplaces and income opportunities, the delivery of vital micronutrients for combatting malnutrition and, not least, a raised diversity of agricultural production systems. However, top-down research approaches generating only knowledge from selected disciplines have reportedly failed to provide smallholder farmers with affordable, practical and readily available solutions to their problems; adoption rates of scientific inventions are low. Interdisciplinary knowledge generation must be embedded in an effective innovation system extending to all stakeholders to bring about change. This paper will present a research frameworka that holistically analyses the food system and AIV value chains of Kenya and bordering regions of Tanzania and Ethiopia using an integrative, inter- and disciplinary framework adapted from natural, social and communication science, ecology, gender studies and development economics, developed by more than one hundred young and senior researchers from Kenya and Germany within a major international research project. As case study, novel empirical results will be presented using the innovation system approach (one of fourteen elements of the research approach) focussing on the systemic determinants of all innovative processes and activities possibly taking place in the Kenyan AIVs sector. Through a focused analysis of factors affecting innovation in the case of AIVs' seed supply and the actors working together, the problem-focused innovation system provides a promising solution(s).},

	volume = {12},
	doi = {10.1007/s10668-009-9195-2},
	abstract = {In subsistence farming systems of the developing world, adoption of resource-conserving practices such as integrated pest management (IPM) is often strikingly low. This has partially been ascribed to researchers' limited understanding of how technologies develop at the interface of the systems' social and ecological components. In Honduras (Central America), there exists concern about limited adoption and diffusion of IPM technologies in certain smallholder production systems. In this study, we determine social and ecological drivers of IPM adoption in subsistence maize production in the country's hillside environment. Honduran small-scale maize production is typified by a key insect pest (the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda) being partly kept at bay through action of a diverse natural enemy complex, including ants, social wasps, carabid beetles, and spiders. Local agricultural landscapes, primarily shaped through shifting cultivation, provide key resources to maintain this natural enemy diversity. These local ecological conditions and related natural enemy abundance strongly influence farmers' agroecological knowledge and pest management practices. In the meantime, farmer practices are also affected by local communication networks, which help validate and spread IPM concepts and technologies. Based on our findings, we advocate a holistic approach to improve IPM extension through mapping of agroecological opportunities, visualization of regional patterns in farmer knowledge, and associated priority setting. Local IPM capacity could be built through institutional strengthening and adaptive comanagement, while IPM training should be linked with natural resource management initiatives. These approaches may eventually improve the way IPM is delivered to small-scale farmers who operate in the ecologically diverse environments of the tropics. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

	volume = {38},
	doi = {10.1071/WR10166},
	abstract = {Context In Asia, losses to rodents contribute to the undernourishment of smallholder families. Ecologically based rodent management (EBRM) has become the national policy for rodent management in rice-based agriculture in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. EBRM requires community action. Therefore we need to develop communication campaigns that increase community involvement in rodent management. Aims This study evaluates the effects of a campaign to promote EBRM in a community that suffers chronic rodent losses to their rice crop. We hypothesised that the campaign would create changes in rodent management by farmers based on key messages delivered. Methods We documented existing beliefs and management practices, and captured changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of smallholder farmers after the campaign. We also document benefits to the community. We used qualitative tools to evaluate existing beliefs and management practices of rodents in nine villages in Zaragosa, one of which was a focus village for the campaign. Key results Farmers who were influenced by the campaign had significantly higher mean rank scores in knowledge and attitudes pertaining to key messages of the campaign, such as working together, proper timing of management actions, and that rodents can be controlled. Farmers who heard the campaign obtained yields that were higher by 0.7tha-1 compared with those with no exposure to the campaign. A year after the campaign, the increase in rice yield in Zaragosa was sufficient to feed 1375 adult Filipinos for a year. The campaign influenced policy on rodent management in Zaragosa and subsequently at the provincial level. Conclusions A media campaign with support from local leaders and extension staff is an effective way to disseminate EBRM, leading to positive economic benefits for smallholder farmers. A media campaign alone is less effective. Implications A communication campaign on EBRM with follow-up support from extension experts is a highly effective pathway for changing attitudes and practices of smallholder farmers on rodent management, and for effective dissemination of EBRM. © 2011 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {For nearly four decades the University of California, Davis, International Programs Office has worked with global partners to build the agricultural capacity of countries in terms of research, extension, and education. With a focus on extension in lesser developed countries, we have developed an innovative framework for teaching extension professionals how to effectively encourage adoption of much-needed knowledge by smallholder farmers. The "ASK ME" framework uses 5 key steps; each of which is represented by one letter in the title of the framework, namely: 1 Audience and Needs: Who are they? What do they need and want? 2. Solutions: What is practical and relevant to meet their needs? 3. Key Message: What do people need to know to make a change? 4. Message Form and Delivery: How can the message best be packaged and delivered? 5. Evaluation: How can each step be improved? This training model has already been adopted in a variety of contexts ranging from US civil servants in Afghanistan to Peace Corps agricultural volunteers. While the teaching of this model is made up of a variety of tools and techniques, the success of the model relies on following its own tenants, including effective communication via a "Key Message". By boiling the potentially complex and interdisciplinary topic of Agricultural Extension into five key components, this model is memorable and easily learned by a wide variety of audiences.},

Today, science, policy, agro-industry and other stakeholder groups are increasingly concerned about the sustainable use of this resource, given the dissipative nature of phosphorus and difficulties in assessing, evaluating, and coping with phosphorus pollution in aquatic and terrestrial systems. We argue that predictions about a forthcoming peak, followed by a quick reduction (i.e., physical phosphate rock scarcity) are unreasoned and stress that access to phosphorus (economic scarcity) is already, and may increasingly become critical, in particular for smallholders farmers in different parts of the world. The paper elaborates on the design, development, goals and cutting-edge contributions of a global transdisciplinary process (i.e. mutual learning between science and society including multiple stakeholders) on the understanding of potential contributions and risks related to the current mode of using phosphor. us on multiple scales (Global TraPs). While taking a global and comprehensive view on the whole phosphorus-supply chain, Global TraPs organizes and integrates multiple transdisciplinary case studies to better answer questions which inform sustainable future phosphorus use. Its major goals are to contribute to four issues central to sustainable resource management: i) long-term management of biogeochemical cycles, in particular the challenge of closing the phosphorus cycle, ii) achieving food security, iii) avoiding environmental pollution and iv) sustainability learning on a global level by transdisciplinary processes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	volume = {18},
	abstract = {By means of quantitative and qualitative research the doctoral dissertation has attained methodical insights into competences and usage levels of new technologies for marketing purposes in agri-businesses in the Republic of Croatia. The results and observations provided in the thesis indicate that swift action is required in order to improve the current situation and prepare farmers for forthcoming changes. In biotechnical sciences there is a need for continuous updating, research and control of interdependent processes and complex relations, which in turn creates a need for a unified system of knowledge dissemination. In order to manage a set of information arising from such processes, it is necessary to have a system that will allow us to store and transfer the acquired knowledge in a safe and simple way in real time, ensuring completeness of information. In today's world, the key role in this process is to be played by information and communication technologies (ICT) encompassing the use of computers and communication technologies, as well as technologies for information management and transfer. Together with other ICT, the Internet is a resource that can bridge the gap between professionals of different expertise on one hand and people living in rural areas and farmers on the other, as it provides a platform for interaction and dialogue. Furthermore, ICT can foster new cooperation and networking through inter-sectoral contacts between government institutions, different support agencies and farmers. The efforts to implement ICT in the agricultural sector are held back by a range of limiting factors, such as: the necessity to reconstruct the sector itself, required investments in new communication systems and adjunct platforms, low levels of computer literacy among farmers, insufficient infrastructure, etc. Taking all this into account, it is obvious that the Internet and modern technologies can be drivers of positive change in agriculture. The primary goal of the dissertation was to develop a theoretical program and process of marketing application in agricultural sector, followed by tactical and strategic options from the standpoint of a particular business entity operating in agriculture, which can occur by using ICT. The analysis has revealed that in Croatia even the theoretical approach to agri-business marketing is underdeveloped, which makes it difficult to implement marketing in daily operations, and to integrate ICT in a particular marketing program and marketing process. Given the specific characteristics of agricultural production, the traditional industrial marketing mix cannot be applied there in a straightforward way. It is more acceptable to observe agricultural activities as a combination of production and services and to take into account the additional "3P" elements (people, processes, physical evidence), which was duly considered in the dissertation. The primary research was conducted in order to determine whether, and to what extent, agri-business operators are prepared to adopt and apply ICT. The qualitative research was carried out by in-depth interviews, whereas CATI method was used for quantitative research. The research was carried out on a random sample of family farm businesses (N=572), with twophase stratification (by the county and village size). Only the farms that were subsidized in 2009 (according to the official document of the Paying Agency for Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development) were included in the survey. Judging by the family farm businesses included in our sample, there is a low level of ICT possession/ usage, as well as ICT competences among farmers. After investigating the cross-tabulation according to demographic indicators, it can be concluded that the average family farm business with the highest level of computer literacy is situated in the Zagreb County, was registered in the period between 2000 and 2005, has its own web-site, livestock farming is its primary activity, carried out on the land plot of 5-10 hectares. This is, of course, the average result intended to generate information on the profile of an ICT-competent family farm business, which does not exclude good examples outside this average profile. The hypothesis proposed in the dissertation was that the agricultural sector has a great potential, with ample room for improvement achievable through benefits brought about by information and communication technologies. This hypothesis was confirmed by the analysis of secondary data and the results of primary research. Substantiating the stated hypothesis can be highlighted as the original scientific contribution of the doctoral dissertation.},

Consistent with theoretical insights related to information inefficiencies, we find that the intervention leads farmers to move away from low-risk low-return crops toward more commercially oriented commodities. Our analysis also suggests that, for the case of maize, the intervention causes farmers to sell less on the market, but at significantly higher prices.},

	abstract = {The rubber boom across much of Southeast Asia has led to environmental destruction, and the resultant crash in the price of rubber has destabilised livelihoods. We investigated the necessary factors required to enable a transition towards a more sustainable model for rubber cultivation in Southwest China (i.e. the ‘greening’ of rubber cultivation), using a framework for the integrative study of multiple aspects in complex land use issues. We present findings from stakeholder interviews and a stakeholder workshop, and discuss their relevance within and beyond Southwest China. The current focus of researchers and development practitioners tends to be on finding technical solutions to address unsustainable rubber cultivation practices. However, stakeholder consultations revealed that the key barriers were more social: low levels of trust and knowledge exchange between stakeholder groups and fragmented visions about the future of the landscape. It is very important to continue the economic prosperity initially brought by rubber, but, without improved communication between government and researchers and smallholder farmers, this will be very difficult to achieve. A wider landscape perspective is needed to address issues in rubber cultivation to avoid repeating the same problems of cash crop boom and bust experienced with other crops, most notably bananas. We conclude that more effort should be put into developing mechanisms that integrate technical knowledge, enhance social relationships, and present a forum for reconciling – or at least acknowledging – the differing needs, knowledge, and objectives of different groups, and transcending the power dynamics between smallholder farmers and government and researchers.},

	abstract = {Agricultural producers grapple with low farm yields and declining ecosystem services within their landscapes. In several instances, agricultural production systems may be considered largely unsustainable in socioeconomic and ecological (resource conservation and use and impact on nature) terms. Novel technological and management options that can serve as vehicles to promote the provision of multiple benefits, including the improvement of smallholder livelihoods, are needed. We call for a paradigm shift to allow designing and implementing agricultural systems that are not only efficient (serving as a means to promote development based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste) but can also be considered synergistic (symbiotic relationship between socio-ecological systems) by simultaneously contributing to major objectives of economic, ecological, and social (equity) improvement of agro-ecosystems. These transformations require strategic approaches that are supported by participatory system-level research, experimentation, and innovation. Using data from several studies, we here provide evidence for technological and management options that could be optimized, promoted, and adopted to enable agricultural systems to be efficient, effective, and, indeed, sustainable. Specifically, we present results from a study conducted in Colombia, which demonstrated that, in rice systems, improved water management practices such as AlternateWetting and Drying (AWD) reduce methane emissions ( 70\%). We also show how women can play a key role in AWD adoption. For livestock systems, we present in vitro evidence showing that the use of alternative feed options such as cassava leaves contributes to livestock feed supplementation and could represent a cost-effective approach for reducing enteric methane emissions (22\% to 55\%). We argue that to design and benefit from sustainable agricultural systems, there is a need for better targeting of interventions that are co-designed, co-evaluated, and co-promoted, with farmers as allies of transformational change (as done in the climate-smart villages), not as recipients of external knowledge. Moreover, for inclusive sustainability that harnesses existing knowledge and influences decision-making processes across scales, there is a need for constant, efficient, effective, and real trans-disciplinary communication and collaboration.},

	abstract = {This study was done to find out about animal health service providers and factors that determined demand for community based veterinary service delivery in smallholder sector of Zimbabwe. Focus group discussions and a questionnaire was used to collect data on veterinary services providers and socio-economic factors related to animal health from a sample (N= 333) smallholder livestock farmers from Gutu district of Masvingo province in Zimbabwe. Analytical techniques used were descriptive statistics, K-mean cluster analysis and Tobit regression model. Results showed that the majority of farmers (45\%) obtained services from both Community Based Animal Health Workers (CBAHWs) and Department of Veterinary Service (DVS), 25\% DVS only, 20\% used CBAHWs while 10\% did not seek any services. Further analysis showed that distance to CBAHW, distance to AHMC and employment status were significantly related to demand for CBAHWs with coefficients of -1.5, 0.7 and -10.3, respectively. The study thus concluded that CBAHW is an alternative animal health service delivery approach already practiced in smallholder farming sectors of Zimbabwe. Socio-economic factors significantly influenced the demand for CBAHW services. Given limited resources by state sponsored veterinary services, it is recommended that the CBAHWs approach should be encouraged as supplementary service provider especially in areas further DVS. These community organizations can be empowered by the state to deliver more improved services based on hygiene and modern science at a relatively low cost to farmers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

But in order to successfully use mobile phones for the optimal development of agricultural markets, understanding the impact of social structure on mobile phone adoption, its uses and perceived impacts are invaluable. Although global assessments of capacity in the use of information communication technology (ICT) devices have been considered, such assessments mask significant geo-spatial variations among local farmers—male and female—with respect to their capacity to effectively use basic mobile phone functions. Documenting and recognizing this is important for the development of national agricultural ICT policies, as well as programmes aimed at increasing farmers’ knowledge and use of ICT for agricultural marketing. This article’s contribution to agricultural marketing and the use of ICT in developing countries (such as Ghana) is anchored in the assessment of the technical capacity and mobile telephone-based market information access to farmers in selected rural districts of Ghana. The selected districts are where most households are poor and heavily dependent on farming as their mainstay, and furthermore, where market information which mobile phones facilitate is crucial to maximizing their incomes.},

The scale and usage of household forests is a critical issue that concerns the methods and efficiency of forest management. By conducting a socio-economic survey of 175 households, this paper examines the status of household forestry as well as its utilization in Shangnan County, northern China, and the way in which farmers and their local forest authority interact. Approximately 80 \% of households were found to have forest land. Among households which had forestry, nearly half had a forest area of 1 μ (0.07 ha) or less. Fuelwood for household use was the main product of household forests. About 70 \% of households regarded fuelwood as their main energy source. Socio-economic factors including financial situation, household size, occupation and educational level of householder were not significantly correlated with the energy choice or the amount of fuelwood consumed. In order to improve the development of household forests, it is necessary to promote better communication between households and forest authorities. The coppice system appears to be a useful forest management strategy because it not only maintains continuous forest cover but also satisfies the high demand for fuelwood in this county.},

A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data. SPSS and STATA were used for descriptive and quantitative analysis.Radio, television and the mobile phone were found to be the most accessible ICTs and were often used to access information on production or/and marketing of bananas. The least accessible ICTs were computers, internet services and video cassettes. Socio-economic factors like age, gender, income and acreage of bananas planted had an influence on the intensity of use of ICT tools as a source of agricultural information by smallholder banana farmers. Use of ICTs was found to influence adoption of tissue culture (TC) bananas. Low levels of education and distance to internet services were found to be the most constraining to the use of ICT tools. Other constraints included: lack of money to buy internet services, digital cameras and computers. Farmers were of the opinion that radio and the mobile phone were the most useful ICT tools while television, print media, internet/email and video cassettes/DVDs were the least useful as a source of information on banana production.This study elucidates the important role of ICTs in disseminating agricultural information. There is need for the government to demystify ICT training at all levels of education to improve local content development. Reduction of taxes on radio-wave licensing and improving accessibility to affordable and quality handsets will aid in intensifying the use of radio and mobile phones by farmers in acquiring information. © 2013 Wageningen University.},

	volume = {18},
	abstract = {Over the past four decades, advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have resulted in unprecedented opportunity and innovation for improving farming outcomes. Ongoing innovations such as mobile, social media, agricultural drones, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and cloud computing presented new challenges and opportunities for agribusinesses to redefine and rethink the role of ICT towards achieving better farming outcomes. With recent advances in infrastructure, data (collection, storage and retrieval), and a better understanding of all aspects of the food chain, new challenges and opportunities are presented. Unstructured data is now being generated real time, in large volumes, at high speed and unknown quality that results in challenges to current approaches for decision making, and requires a focus on analytics. These new sources of data create the opportunity to inform and drive a change in decision making from one that is highly intuitive to one that is data driven and processed in real-time. This paper highlights recent trends in ICT and introduces hybrid cloud architecture for smart farming. The proposed architecture emphasizes data-driven, farmer-centered, and knowledge-based decision tools through service integration, aggregation and interoperation. As a customized solution for farmers, the proposed architecture contains components of 1) data integration of on-farm sensors and data from public sources, 2) farm management modules, 3) knowledge-based software solutions from different providers, 4) service integration, aggregation and interoperation, and 5) a customized dashboard focused on usefulness and usability. This cloud-based solution allows the integration of businesses services, things, and technology from any channel and can be used anywhere. At this time, hybrid cloud environments have shown promise to integrate these different services and provide smart farming solutions to both big and smallholder farmers.},

	abstract = {Human livelihood needs and nature conservation often contradict. Yet, healthy ecosystems are crucial for human livelihood quality. The semi-arid regions of East Africa suffer under demographic pressure and soil depletion. Ecosystem degradation becomes particularly visible along rivers in semiarid regions of south-east Kenya, where former pristine riparian forests have been transformed into agricultural fields and settlements with negative effects on ecosystem services. In this study, we aim to understand how local smallholders perceive the challenges for the riparian ecosystems and what factors affect their engagement in environmental conservation. We surveyed about 200 farmers and performed expert interviews with representatives from governmental institutions from the field of land- and resource management along Nzeeu River in south-east Kenya. We assessed the level of education, land use practices, environmental knowledge, attitudes and the willingness to contribute to nature conservation. We tested for spatial bias to understand smallholders’ perceptions on environmental challenges. Our data show that land division due to inheritance is not perceived as a problem by the farmers. However, owners holding {\textless} 1 ha of land property are less willing to spare some of their land for conservation, as opposed to those holding land plots above this size. Despite a high level of general willingness to conserve ecosystems, our data underline that local people hardly actively engage in conservation action. Furthermore, our data indicate a communication gap between local smallholders and regional governmental officers as well as overconfidence in mass media through the radio which can contradict successful adoption of pro-environment behavior. Sustainable land management in our study area is not a matter of education, but depends from the size of land property. There is an urgent need to bridge this communication gap, as a prerequisite to improve sustainable land management.},

	abstract = {Food-borne diseases are attracting a lot of attention in Vietnam as a result of repeated episodes of adulterated and unsafe food. In this paper, we provide some perspectives on food safety in Vietnam from the point of view of an international research institution working on food safety with partners in the country. We argue that one of the key issues of food safety in Vietnam is that certain food value chain stakeholders lack ethics, which leads to the production and trading of unsafe foods in order to make profits irrespective of adverse health effects on consumers. In turn, the shortfall in ethical behaviours around food can be attributed to a lack of incentives or motivating factors. Although food safety causes panic in the population, it is unclear how much contaminated food contributes to the burden of food-borne diseases and food poisonings in Vietnam. However, globally, the biggest health problem associated with food are infections from consuming food contaminated with viruses, bacteria or parasites. A major food safety challenge is the inappropriate way of communicating food risks to the public. Another key constraint is the inherent difficulty in managing food in wet markets and from smallholder production. On the other hand, local foods, and local food production and processing are an important cultural asset as well as being essential to food safety, and these aspects can be put at risk if food safety concerns motivate consumers to purchase more imported foods. In this paper, we also discuss good experiences in food safety management from other countries and draw lessons learnt for Vietnam on how to better deal with the current food safety situation.},

	abstract = {Climate change threatens to derail the lives and livelihoods of farmers all over the world if appropriate adaptation measures are not put in place. Smallholder farmers, more so those in developing countries like the Philippines, are especially at risk because of inherent socio-economic characteristic and environmental factors limiting their capacity to adapt. One adaptation measure that can potentially benefit smallholder farmers is agroforestry. However limited understanding, incorrect information and a negative mindset could hinder the successful adoption of this practice. This case study of smallholder farmers in Peñablanca, Cagayan, Philippines attempts to explain the farmers’ adaptation practices by analyzing their knowledge and attitudes on climate change and agroforestry. Two sets of surveys, one on adaptation practices (n=600) and one on knowledge and attitudes (n=41) were conducted with smallholder farmers in Peñablanca. Most farmers are aware of the basic concepts of climate change (91\%) and agroforestry (84\%), specifically of the impacts of climate extremes on their farms and of the benefits of agroforestry. However this may not always translate to correct practice of agroforestry and other adaptation measures. It is recommended that information, education, and communication programs on climate change and agroforestry for farmers should present targeted information on impacts and adaptation in a way that is relatable and understandable to them.},

Resource and infrastructure challenges often limit the ability of programs to expand through the use of extension and other forms of in-person training. Although media such as radio, television, and mobile phones cannot replace the value of interpersonal communication, they can offer a low-cost alternative for reaching large audiences in even some of the most remote regions. With the increasing use of media for sustainable development come questions relating to the ability of these channels to move beyond a one-way flow of information to include and respond to local knowledge and experiences and to create dialogue, both farmer to farmer and between farmers and designers of educational messaging. This article evaluates the role of media in promoting sustainable agriculture in Zambia. Specifically, the findings present qualitative feedback from 34 smallholder farmers targeted by Community Markets for Conservation’s current radio programming efforts around sustainable agriculture. Results demonstrate the centrality of the radio program alongside other forms of communication, such as extension and farmer-to-farmer communication, as well as written and visual communication. These findings consider direct and indirect exposure to these efforts and the importance of radio in offering a foundation for dialogue and increased social diffusion of sustainable innovations in remote regions.},

	abstract = {The dairy value chain (DVC) in Malawi has been identified by the USAID as a high potential area to develop markets and improve nutritional options, and smallholder dairying has received governmental priority within the livestock sector since 1979. Improvements in education, from the farmer to the academic researcher, are critical as part of capacity building to support the dairy industry in Malawi. Institutions of higher education, such as the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), are in unique positions to build intellectual capital, address educational needs along the DVC, and sustainably develop the capacity to address development challenges. A tri-lateral partnership with universities from Malawi (LUANAR), the United States (Michigan State University) and India (Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University) was formed, to utilize collective strengths and experiences, to build educational capacity at LUANAR and provide graduates with needed knowledge and skills to support the DVC in Malawi. The central aim of the project was to enhance higher education capacities at LUANAR for curriculum development, applied technical instruction, and agricultural community engagement in Malawi, using evidence-based strategies for economic development and enhancement of the dairy livestock value chain. Needs assessments of the DVC and its stakeholders were completed to identify needs, challenges and opportunities. Stakeholders (extension workers, farmers, processors, marketers/retailers) identified specific needs, skills, and services to support the DVC, and farmers identified specific constraints to dairy production and marketing. Strategies to improve LUANAR’s capacity to address DVC stakeholder needs were implemented. Institutional capacity building efforts, using a process-oriented framework emphasizing long-term sustained impact, focused on developing training and outreach focused on drivers of rural economic growth and poverty reduction, mainstreaming outreach into the local dairy sector, and promoting innovative outreach and teaching approaches. Communication between stakeholders and LUANAR improved, faculty received research and educational training, interdisciplinary teaching and research increased, and new curricula for DVC certificate programs were created. The learning experiences for LUANAR faculty and students resulted in significant scholarship pursuits, generation of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary DVC curriculum, field level-case studies and practical interventions to address stakeholder needs. The project enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, and provided faculty with valuable training and skills to support training the next generation of educators, researchers, and workers that will serve the DVC in the future.},

It addresses opinions on the inclusion of climate change mitigation strategies (such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-REDD+) into cocoa production, and potential obstacles and roles of stakeholders in ensuring community acceptance of such strategies in a unique multiple land use area-the Krokosua Hills Forest Reserve. Data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency and through survey of 205 cocoa farmers were assessed with Mann-Kendall, KruskalWallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Farmers' perceptions of changes in climate were notably diverse and did not always match historic weather data, but accurately described increases in temperature and drought which are linked to cocoa productivity. Farmers appreciate the importance of tree maintenance for ecosystem services but were skeptical of financially rewarding climate change strategies which favor tree protection. Cultural practices associated with cocoa production encourage carbon release and may pose a threat to the objectives of REDD+. Farmers' experience on the land, interactions with other farmers, government extension agents and cocoa buyers all influence cocoa agroforestry practices in the area, and communication through existing entities (particularly extension agents) presents a pathway to community acceptance of climate change mitigation strategies. The study recommends reforms in REDD+ strategies to adopt flexible and participatory frameworks to facilitate adoption and acceptability due to pronounced heterogeneity in community perceptions and knowledge of climate change and related issues.},

	abstract = {In a world where the notion of 'sharing of knowledge' has gained much prominence in the recent past, the importance of information and communications technologies (ICTs) to promote sustainable agriculture, especially when combined with mobile and open source software technologies is discussed critically. On this rationale, this study was carried out to explore the applicability of the concept of converging 'Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)' to promote sustainable knowledge sharing amongst the agricultural communities in Sri Lanka. A multi-stage community consultative process with a set of designated officials ("Sponsors") and a series of semi-structured questionnaire survey with a cross section of smallholder agriculture farmers (n=246), were carried out in the Batticaloa, Kurunegala and Puttalam districts to gather the baseline data. This was followed by a number of field experiments ("Campaigns") with the farmers (n=340) from same geographical areas. The two FOSS, namely: (1) "FrontlineSMS" for 'Text Messaging' and (2) "FreedomFone" for 'Interactive Voice Responses', were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge sharing within the farming communities. It was found that FOSS intervention increases the 'Text messaging' and 'Voice Call' usage in day-to-day agricultural communication by 26 and 8 percent, respectively. The demographic factors like age and educational level of the farmers have a positive influence on the knowledge sharing process. And also the 'Mobile Telephony' was the most extensive mode of communication within the communities. The outcome of analysis, as a whole, implies that, with a fitting mechanism in place, this approach can be promoted as a "drive for positive changes" in agriculture-based rural communities in developing countries like Sri Lanka, and those in South and East Asia with similar socioeconomic and cultural perspectives.},

	abstract = {Farmers in Africa are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to their high dependency on climate-sensitive natural resources. Kenyan farmers are faced with limited public agricultural extension services, narrowing their sources of useful information including adaptive strategies that would help them cope with the impacts of climate change. Radio can be an efective extension tool with the ability to reach many farmers in their local language. This study investigated the potential of radio in influencing the utilization of climate change information by farmers in Kilifi County located along the Kenyan coast. Education and communication about climate change was undertaken using radio to make available and understandable information to different social and cultural groups. This study revealed that radio can effectively complement other agricultural extension methods and has the potential to engage farmers on climate change issues and motivate them to take action, if appropriate approaches are used. Although very few of the farmers surveyed (33\%) reported to have listened to the programs, a high percentage (82\%) of those who did implemented the recommended strategies and technologies they heard. The major challenges reported by farmers to accessing the radio programs were lack of a radio and unsuitable program timing. An additional reported challenge was the inability to store or record the programs resulting in farmers relying on their own recollection when implementing strategies. Further research should explore the use of social learning approaches that encourage group rather than individual listenership (such as community listening clubs and community-based radio schools) to overcome these challenges.},

	abstract = {Increased legume productivity contributes to nutritional security as they are a source of cheap proteins. However, there is limited access to information on improved legume technologies among smallholder farmers in resource poor countries such as Tanzania. This chapter is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of communication channels (i.e. demonstration plots, farmer field days, technological briefs) on level of awareness and the determinants of adoption of improved common bean technologies among smallholder farmers in Tanzania. The study on which the chapter is based used a cross-sectional design on 400 households in Gairo and Mvomero districts, Tanzania. Results show that more than a half of the farmers were aware of all the seven improved legume technologies assessed. However, the level of awareness on all the technologies differed across the treatments, with a high level of the awareness recorded in areas with interventions. Among others, intervention included sharing information with farmers on land preparation, legume variety selection, use of quality seed, fertiliser application at planting, planting and spacing, weeding, control of insect and storage pests and diseases, harvesting and storage and safe use of chemicals. The awareness was low in areas without intervention. Nonetheless, there was a low level of adoption of the improved legume technologies. This could be due to the fact that the intervention was at its initial stage of implementation; but it was expected to increase with time as knowledge diffuses to the communities. In addition, as pointed out in the focus group discussions, low adoption could be because of difficulties in accessing improved bean technologies (high costs associated), unavailability of improved seeds and absence of seed dealers nearby villages. The factors significantly (p ≤ 0.05) associated with smallholder farmers’ adoption of improved legume technologies were visits by extension officers, age of household head, being member of a farmers’ association, revenue from other income-generating activities and household size. Therefore, it can be concluded that a combination of demonstration plots, farmer field days and technological briefs (leaflets and brochures) accounted for the effective communication and awareness creation. Thus, it is recommended that the government and non-governmental organisations should invest more in awareness creation approaches in order to make sure that all smallholder farmers are sensitised on the improved legume technologies. In addition, the government and non-governmental organisations should insist more on visits by extension officers, formation of/joining farmers association and participating in other income-generating activities to enhance adoption of improved legume technologies.},

	abstract = {Oil palm is an important industrial, livelihood and food crop in Ghana. Smallholders produce the bulk of the palm fruits and small-scale processors, mainly women, produce most of the crude palm oil. Poor practices lead to a high proportion of free fatty acids in the crude palm oil and the processors thus cannot access remunerative national and international markets. Exploratory and diagnostic studies identified the absence of rules and regulations governing processing as a major factor. An innovation platform was convened and facilitated to remove the identified institutional constraints. Based on event tracing, this paper reports a study of the effects of the innovation platform's interventions and how these were achieved. Institutional entrepreneurs are shown to play important roles: they mobilised resources such as expertise, knowledge, access to information and high-level political power to influence small-scale processors to adopt alternative practices. The institutional changes observed are shown to arise in cooperation between traditional authorities (chiefs), the district legislature and authorities at the national level, who together institutionalised the experimental actions and processes taken in the study area. The institutional elements they most affected were: rules and regulations, the legitimacy of new practices and organisational arrangements, co-generation of knowledge, material resources, and the strategic and communication skills of key actors.},

Despite the fact that extension practitioners face many problems in this area of their work, there is currently a lack of academic literature that systematically addresses the topic and offers concrete guidelines for practice. Thus, this paper will aim to clarify the benefits of farmers' groups, associations and networks within the context of family farming, systematise problems faced by rural extensionists when working with farmers' groups and associations, provide conceptual tools for understanding group and associative processes, and construct a set of guidelines and recommendations for facing said problems. In order to achieve these aims, the authors conducted an extensive literature review and drew upon their personal experience on the topic. Results suggest that some of the benefits of associative work are: better access to inputs, produce and credit markets, the facilitation of learning processes, the empowerment of family farmers as social actors, and a reduction of rural extension costs. Additionally, with respects to the problems faced by extensionists, the following can be highlighted: individualist attitudes and conflicts between farmers, scarce participation and commitment, problems with leaderships and with organisations' administrative management, and the lack of extensionists' training to address these processes, among others. With regards to the factors that increase trust and cooperation are: interpersonal communication and mutual knowledge, sharing problems, values and objectives, and the existence of shared rules for the functioning of the group that include sanctions for transgressors. In this context, the extensionists' role will be that of facilitating processes of construction of group relationships, creating rules for the groups' functioning and developing the group's capacities for self-management.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of tomato diseases and local smallholder farmer knowledge was assessed in five villages in the Morogoro Region of Tanzania during the rainy and dry production seasons. The most commonly occurring foliar diseases in both seasons were early blight (88 of 100 fields), bacterial spot/speck (49), viral diseases (42) and Septoria leaf spot (34). Bacterial spot/speck, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, other viral diseases, and late blight were present in significantly higher numbers of fields during the rainy season than the dry season, while significantly more plants per field were affected by early blight in the rainy season than the dry season. A root health assay was conducted to assess root knot nematode damage and root rot severity, and root knot nematodes were found in 44 of 50 fields surveyed. Farmers used local names for plant diseases, which tended to be associated with the symptomatology of the disease, concepts borrowed from other aspects of life, perceived causal agent or weather conditions. Identification of local names improved communication between farmers and researchers and elucidated how farmers perceived key diseases in the region. Extension materials were developed to improve farmers’ identification and management of key tomato diseases in the region. Farmers can better allocate limited resources to manage key diseases through an improved understanding of prevalent diseases and local plant disease knowledge. This study serves as an example of how plant pathologists can develop a baseline understanding of key regional plant disease constraints through the integration of field surveys and ethnophytopathological studies.},

	isbn = {978-1-316-58526-9},
	abstract = {Introduction. Genetic modification (GM) technology has great potential to improve agricultural productivity and contribute to food security challenges in Africa when properly regulated. The adoption of GM technology continues to increase in the developing world, particularly among smallholder farmers. The 2015 report of the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) showed that, for Africa, this is the 18th year of successful commercialisation of biotech crops. Only three African countries planted GM crops in 2015, Burkina Faso, South Africa and Sudan (James, 2015). The lack of an enabling policy and legal environment for biosafety regulation, among other factors, currently serves as a hindrance to the adoption of GM crops in Africa. In West Africa, only three countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana and Nigeria) have functional biosafety laws that allow laboratory and field experimentation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to take place, while three countries (Mali, Senegal and Togo) have biosafety laws without field trials (Figure 23.1). Other factors that have contributed to the slow adoption of this technology in West Africa include the limited critical mass of regulators with enhanced competencies in biosafety and the seeming lack of biosafety communication and cooperation. Biosafety activities by the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) Agency African Biosafety Network of Expertise (ABNE; www.nepadbiosafety.net) and other biosafety service providers are key to enhancing the knowledge and skills of regulators, scientists, lawyers and policy/decision-makers in adopting best practices for performing their mandated functions and also broadening their understanding of core issues in biosafety decision-making, thereby increasing confidence in the regulatory system. In the same vein, we cannot underestimate the impact of the constantly expressed concerns of the environmentalists and activists that have led to the slow adoption or non-adoption of the technology in many African countries, including West Africa. In this chapter we discuss achievements made by Burkina Faso with insect-resistant (Bt) cotton, especially how it has benefited small-scale farmers; how Burkina Faso became a showcase for GM technology in Africa; the current scenario of the technology in West Africa with a focus on Burkina Faso's experience; and developments in other West African countries, specifically Ghana and Nigeria.},

	abstract = {Land use transformation at the farm level is attributed to household decision-making, reflected by the behavior and activities of smallholder farmers. Unfortunately, household decision-making in local communities and its determinants are site-specific and hardly understood. This study uses multistage purposive selection of households as a unit for the analysis to investigate the transformation from pure agriculture to farm forest mosaics, especially through woodlot establishment. We use key informants, household surveys, and observations to obtain data on decision-making amongst 84 farm households in Nyantonzi parish, Masindi district, Uganda, as an example. Specifically, the study addresses four research questions. Firstly, what is the current status of gender-based decision-making at the household level? Secondly, is decision making within farm households individualistic or collective? Thirdly, which factors are considered to select annual, perennial and tree-crop farm management regimes? Fourthly, what determinants influence the decision-making process and the likelihood ofwoodlot establishment? A multilevel analysis comprising parametric statistical models and binary logistic regression is applied to assess difference in household natural, physical, human, and social capital, highlight gender roles, and obtain factors associated to selection of crops and determinants of woodlot establishment at the farm level, respectively. Results reveal that gender based decision-making is clearly disaggregated on the basis of husbands and wives and it is individualistic, mostly dominated by husbands with lower participation by wives and other family members. Households consider various factors before making any decisions, e.g., market prices for both annual and perennial crops, food consumption for annual crops, ease of management, and yields from the previous season for the tree-crop management regimes. The likelihood for woodlot establishment is positively influenced by the willingness and intention of households to establish woodlots and relative age of household head. However, knowledge of land use Policies, Laws, and Regulations (PLRs) in relation to tree planting and harvesting and access to non-farm income reduce the likelihood of woodlot establishment. Here, we recommend that current and future forest land restoration initiatives focus on reducing the gender gap and increase women's participation in decision making, provide market information platforms on wood products, and include woodlot farmers in social organization. Current PLRs on tree tenure should be improved and clearly communicated by using the existing communication assets and social gatherings as channels of change and influence for decision-making.},

The research in this paper is then discussed within the context of research on information and communication technologies (ICTS) for development. Next, the paper presents the ICT-enhanced participatory radio campaign approach and ICT innovations introduced by Farm Radio International, a Canadian nongovernmental organization. The paper analyzes two participatory radio campaigns that use both listening groups and ICTs to engage African farmers. Research on these radio campaigns in six African countries is reported to examine how the participatory approach impacted listenership, knowledge and initial adoption of agricultural techniques and practices presented in the radio campaigns. The authors conclude that the findings of research on these projects could be highly relevant for increasing awareness and adoption of agricultural practices in Sub-Saharan Africa. They also appear promising for other development sectors and for other developing regions.},

To explore the influence factors of the adoption of green control techniques (GCTs) by family farms, this study focused on sample selection problems, namely, understanding (or not) and willingness (or not), using bivariate probit and regression linear models based on a field survey data from 676 family farms in Huang-huai-hai Plain. Estimation results showed that: 1) the frequency of neighbor communication, the strengths of the extension of agricultural technique sector and media publicity, education, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant positive influences on information collection individually; however, the gender of farmers had a significant negative influence. 2) The perceived ease of use and usefulness about the technique, the number of laborers, the strength of the extension of agricultural technique sector, education, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant positive influences on adoption willingness. 3) Finally, the perceived ease of use and usefulness about the technique, fund status, the strengths of media publicity and the extension of agricultural technique sector, and education of farmers had significant positive influences on adoption intensity; whereas the frequency of neighbor communion, gender, and degree of risk preference of farmers had significant negative influences on adoption intensity. Thus, to develop the GCTs successfully, the Chinese government should improve the effects of technique training, ameliorate financing environment, focus on publicity and guidance, establish and improve the system of education and training for family farmers, and strengthen the team concerning the extended construction of grassroots technique.},

These farmers are vulnerable to exploitations by dominant groups caused by their lack of capital, lack of inputs, lack of post-harvest facilities, and lack of information to trade directly to the market. The rapid growth of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) provides ways to share and access information. ICT in agriculture, also known as e-agriculture, provides solutions to agricultural challenges. The present study focuses on business-to-business e-commerce and investigates how it can be applied in the Philippine setting. The purpose of this study is to develop a B2B e-commerce framework that will facilitate smallholders' access to agricultural inputs and connections to suppliers and buyers. As a result of literature review and initial interviews, the structure and flow of information of the proposed B2B framework is presented.

	doi = {10.1007/s10526-017-9820-1},
	abstract = {When anthropologists interviewed Honduran and Nepali smallholders in the mid-1990s, they were told that “Insects are a terrible mistake in God’s creation” and “There’s nothing that kills them, except for insecticides”. Even growers who maintained a close bond with nature were either entirely unaware of natural pest control, or expressed doubt about the actual value of these services on their farm. Farmers’ knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards pests and natural enemies are of paramount importance to the practice of biological control, but are all too often disregarded. In this study, we conduct a retrospective analysis of the extent to which social science facets have been incorporated into biological control research over the past 25 years. Next, we critically examine various biological control forms, concepts and technologies using a ‘diffusion of innovations’ framework, and identify elements that hamper their diffusion and farm-level uptake. Lastly, we introduce effective observation-based learning strategies, such as farmer field schools to promote biological control, and list how those participatory approaches can be further enriched with information and communication technologies (ICT). Although biological control scientists have made substantial technological progress and generate nearly 1000 papers annually, only a fraction (1.4\%) of those address social science or technology transfer aspects. To ease obstacles to enhanced farmer learning about biological control, we describe ways to communicate biological control concepts and technologies for four divergent agricultural knowledge systems (as identified within a matrix built around ‘cultural importance’ and ‘ease of observation’). Furthermore, we describe how biological control innovations suffer a number of notable shortcomings that hamper their farm-level adoption and subsequent diffusion, and point at ways to remediate those by tactical communication campaigns or customized, (ICT-based) adult education programs. Amongst others, we outline how video, smart phones, or tablets can be used to convey key ecological concepts and biocontrol technologies, and facilitate social learning. In today’s digital era, cross-disciplinary science and deliberate multi-stakeholder engagement will provide biocontrol advocates the necessary means to bolster farmer adoption rates, counter-act surging insecticide use, and restore public trust in one of nature’s prime services.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.05.026},
	abstract = {Smallholder livestock producers are a diverse population with wide ranging motivations for keeping livestock. The biosecurity risk posed by smallholders has been the subject of much conjecture, with comparisons often made between the level of animal health and biosecurity knowledge of smallholders, versus that of commercial livestock producers. This research aimed to gain a better understanding of current knowledge of smallholder production in Australia, particularly in relation to biosecurity and emergency animal disease, and to investigate the relationships that exist between smallholders and the organisations and individuals from which they seek information, assistance and support. Engagement with stakeholders is an important component of an effective biosecurity communication strategy as the dissemination of biosecurity related information from a single source cannot be expected to satisfy the needs of such a broad ranging population. A qualitative study involving a review of literature, semi-structured interviews with government and non-government stakeholders and the development of smallholder and stakeholder influence and interest grids was undertaken. This paper forms part of a broader mixed methods research project among smallholders. Results from the stakeholder analysis showed variation in the parameters used to define smallholders and in the level of stakeholder involvement. Smallholders identified breeding consultants, other producers, private veterinarians and family, friends and colleagues as having a significant to high level of interest and potential to influence their practices. Government agencies were perceived to only have some level of interest but significant influence. Industry stakeholders and rural suppliers were positioned in the quadrant reflecting perceived low levels of interest and influence. The interest and influence grid developed from stakeholder's perspectives demonstrate a clustering around the mid points for both interest and influence, with the exception of those from industry who described low levels of interest and influence. Commonwealth and State government stakeholders reported a higher level of interest than influence. Veterinarians, both government and private, reported some to significant levels of interest and influence. In contrast to the results from the smallholder grid, rural suppliers reported relatively high levels of both interest and influence. The current study demonstrates that to maximise the effectiveness of biosecurity communication, there is a need for government and industry organisations to further engage with all stakeholders involved with smallholders.},

A sample of 350 farmers living in this region was selected through a multi-stage stratified and random sampling method. Principal component analysis revealed that three components play a role in the farmers’ decisions on adaptation methods, namely, farm production practices, farm financial management, and government programs and insurance. The relative influence of the factors listed under each of the three components was assessed using a multiple linear regression analysis. Our analysis showed that these factors accounted for 50\%, 25\%, and 40\% of the adaptation responses analyzed, respectively. In sum, our findings yield recommendations for agriculture extension and risk communication strategies that could promote adaptation behavior among Iranian farmers.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using cellphone technology as a training tool on smallholder dairy farms (SDFs) in Kenya. This field trial was carried out between June and September 2017 on 40 farms randomly selected from members of the Naari Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society in Naari sub-location of Meru County, Kenya. An abridged dairy management handbook, developed by Farmers Helping Farmers and the University of Prince Edward Island, was translated into the local dialect, and disseminated as short message text. After pre-intervention knowledge and attitudes assessments on dairy management, farms were randomly allocated into intervention and comparison groups. Using an online short message service interface (because the study population all had cell phones but only 1.7\% had smart phones), short messages on management practices were sent daily, for 3 months, to the phones owned by the farmers in the intervention group. Post-intervention assessment of dairy management knowledge and attitudes related to the messages was done 3 weeks post-intervention. Within and between group comparisons and net changes were determined using t-tests, Chi-squared tests where applicable. There were no significant demographic or knowledge differences between the two groups pre-intervention. Compared to pre-intervention, trained farmers in the intervention group were significantly more informed on: mastitis prevention, disease (calf diarrhea) prevention, stall management, the role of a balanced nutritious diet on immunity and the resolution of some health conditions post-intervention. Translation of message content to the local language and using easily understandable terminology were reported to be helpful for better understanding and motivation of farmers to implement recommendations. Cellphone technology with a short message service interface can be an effective training tool for SDFs in remote areas of Kenya located far from where seminars are conducted for dairy farmers.},

	abstract = {Edutainment, the combination of education with entertainment through various media such as television, radio, mobile phone applications and games, is increasingly being used as an approach to stimulate innovation and increase agricultural productivity amongst smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Shamba Shape Up, a widely publicised makeover reality TV programme, is an example of edutainment that has received considerable attention, and airs in three countries in East Africa where it is estimated to be watched by millions of viewers. There is no published academic research on the influence of makeover television formats on innovation systems and processes in smallholder agriculture. Using an Agricultural Innovation Systems approach, this paper explores how makeover edutainment is influencing smallholder farmer innovation systems together with the effect this is having on smallholder farms. In the absence of previous research, it articulates a Theory of Change which draws on research traditions from mass communication, agricultural extension and innovation systems. Data came from two large scale quantitative (n = 9885 and n = 1572) surveys and in-depth participatory qualitative research comprising focus group discussions, participatory budgets, agricultural timelines, case studies and key information interviews in Kenya. An estimated 430,000 farmers in the study area were benefiting from their interaction with the programme through increased income and / or a range of related social benefits including food security, improving household health, diversification of livelihood choices, paying school fees for children and increasing their community standing / social capital. Participatory research showed SSU enhanced an already rich communication environment and strengthened existing processes of innovation. It helped set the agenda for discussions within farming communities about opportunities for improving smallholder farms, while also giving specific ideas, information and knowledge, all in the context of featured farm families carefully selected so that a wide range of viewers would identify with them and their challenges. Broadcasts motivated and inspired farmers to improve their own farms through a range of influences including entertainment, strong empathy with the featured host farm families, the way ideas emerged through interaction with credible experts, and importantly through stimulating widespread discussion and interaction amongst and between farmers and communities of experts on agricultural problems, solutions and opportunities. The fact that local extension workers also watched the programmes further enhanced the influence on local innovation systems. The findings indicate that well designed makeover edutainment can strongly influence agricultural innovation processes and systems resulting in impact on the agricultural production and behaviours of large numbers of smallholder farmers.},

	abstract = {Science should be capable of covering issues as diverse as farming systems, technology, innovation, climate change adaptation, poverty alleviation, extension, policy and practice, as they all relate to sustainable agriculture and development. Some years ago, the call for a new farming systems approach was raised to accommodate the principles of interdisciplinary, systems thinking and participatory research. Society calls for systems performance that provides stability and sustainability (SDGs!), multi-scale and territorial approaches and looks for solutions for critical issues such as employment, migration and inclusion/exclusion at the global level (World Society). We propose here a way in dealing with this complexity by addressing the mentioned problem from the communication and symbolic perspective, i.e. to consider the »object» within agricultural science but mainly observe the dedicated systems of communication. By using the concept of social systems, we can accommodate under it systems as diverse as farms, extension organizations, innovation patterns, (agricultural) sciences, policy and politics, farmer and indigenous knowledge, markets and value chains, but always in the form of communication. As such, we remain within a discipline with the potential to evolve towards a promising sub-discipline of agricultural sciences (or of sociology?). The relatively new farming approach of certified organic in combination with agroecology is relevant for family farms and small-scale entities. It depends much more on societal support for extension, technology development and policy coherence than commercial farms. Organic agriculture, with its standards, technological requirements and consumer preferences is nested in socio-economic and political networks, which makes it challenging for researchers to integrate the various components. This challenge applies particularly to countries with poorly developed institutions, weak organizations and within the context of poverty and rural exodus. We therefore use a unified approach under a single scientific system. This system observes, analyses and reports on communication aspects of involved (observed!) social systems (including networks and interactions) within the society of any given nation, including the realities of globalized markets. We are developing a case study based in Mali, in which we apply this method. The case is describing a planning process involving cotton farmers from the Sikasso region, the cotton industry, public and private extension systems, farmer organizations, local governments, the NARS (IER), FiBL, donors and the national institutions involved in climate change adaptation and food security. Various technological options of production (conventional, organic) and farming systems are available. The reflexive use of science dealing with human behavior may facilitate the pragmatic participation of researchers from various disciplines in addressing the uncertainties and opportunities that lie ahead of us and achieve the required impacts together with the practitioners.},

	abstract = {Description of the subject. To boost the development of the national palm oil sector, one of the most promising moves for the Cameroonian government would be to improve partnerships between agro-industries and smallholders in order to increase the latter’s plantation yields and oil extraction rates. Objectives. Drawing on successful experiences in Southeast Asia, this paper examines the conditions for establishing a win-win partnership between agro-industrial companies and smallholders in the Cameroonian palm oil sector. Method. The study was carried out in three production basins in the Centre and the Southwest regions of Cameroon where such partnerships were initiated before the collapse of the National Aid Fund for Rural Development (FONADER) in the 1970s. In participatory workshops involving at least twelve stakeholders (palm oil producers, artisanal and industrial millers, intermediaries and agricultural extension services), the participants’ knowledge was integrated together through individual and collective reflection, with a guarantee of equal expression and consideration of views. Two workshops followed a strict adaptation of Participatory Prospective Analysis (PPA); a third followed a semi-directed participatory approach. Interactions between participants produced definitions of the systems studied and the variables involved, different plausible future scenarios, and recommendations for decision making. Results. Access to technical and managerial capacity building, terms of the contract, access to shareholding in the company by smallholders, and legalization of the terms of the contract emerged as the major items that would influence a sustainable partnership between agro-industries and smallholders. Conclusions. Participatory derived recommendations show that long-term partnerships between agro-industry and smallholders depend on a negotiated contract agreement between the partners to ensure transparency and trust. In addition, a dedicated smallholder department in charge of village plantations within agro-industrial companies can facilitate communication between partners.},

We use the notions of institutional carriers and activity systems to study the evolution of the prevailing “smallholder” institutional logic of Ghanaian agriculture toward an incoming “value-chain” institutional logic concerned with linking farmers to output markets, improving the knowledge base in agriculture, and increasing its information intensity. We draw on a mixed-methods approach, including in-depth qualitative interviews, focus groups, observations, and detailed secondary quantitative data. We cultivate activity theory as a practice-based lens for structuring inquiry into institutional change. We find that information artifacts served to link the activities of farmers that were embedded in the smallholder logic with those of agricultural-development actors that promoted the value-chain logic. Hybridization occurred through the use of artifacts with different interaction modalities. In terms of conceptualizing change, our findings suggest that hybridization of the two logics may be an intermediary point in the long transition from the smallholder toward the value-chain logic.},

This article analyzes their orientation to the market, testing the hypothesis that their search for other possibilities of sale could take advantage of the relationship with consumers, adopting a relational marketing approach. We investigate their relation with the short circuits of commercialization (SCC), identifying the motivations and difficulties for their insertion in these circuits, differentiating them into clusters according to the market orientation practiced. We have identified that all are sensitive to forms of segmenrelationship marketing, but that they largely do not practice it. Within the different clusters, however, there are several farmers with sensitivity, experience and knowledge for a qualified bi-directional communication and goal-sharing with consumers.They could be the basis for an organizational strategy of relational marketing.},

Double matching at the district- and household-levels is implemented to address potential selection bias. Results indicate a positive direct effect of internet and phones on farmers’ market participation and volume decisions on the national market. Those with ICT access are more likely to sell on the foreign market than those without ICT access. The marginal effects suggest that internet access tends to have larger impacts on volume decisions than phones. In addition to direct effects, we find that internet access has significant and positive spillover effects on market participation and volume decisions in the national market. Without implementing matching procedures, the magnitude of the ICT effect tends to be smaller. Results provide empirical support for policies and social programmes that promote ICT especially internet usage in rural Peru to improve smallholder farmers’ marketing performance.},

	abstract = {Ugandan smallholder farmers need to feed a growing population, but their efforts are hampered by declining soil fertility rates. Agricultural extension can facilitate farmers’ access to new practices and technologies, yet farmers are understandably often hesitant to adopt new behaviors. New knowledge assimilation is an important component of behavior change that is often overlooked or poorly addressed by current extension efforts. We implemented a Fertility Management Education Program (FMEP) in central Uganda to investigate smallholder farmers’ existing soil knowledge and their assimilation of new scientific concepts into their knowledge framework. Qualitative data were collected through participant observation, farmer interviews, and focus groups, and coded for using a priori and emergent themes. Our exploration revealed some notable similarities between farmers’ soil knowledge and scientific concepts, particularly in regards to soil health concepts, a discovery that could facilitate communication between extension agents and farmers. However, certain scientific concepts are either unknown to farmers or discordant with existing soil knowledge; these concepts are unlikely to be assimilated by farmers without convincing and concerted extension efforts. Importantly, we found that the combination of new scientific knowledge and hands-on experimentation with novel practices gave farmers far greater confidence in implementing improved soil management practices. Our study provides evidence that extension programs should engage directly with farmers’ existing soil knowledge to develop their understanding of key biological concepts and confidence in implementing improved practices.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.njas.2018.06.001},
	abstract = {Maize production is of critical importance to smallholder farmers in Ghana. Various factors limit the productivity of smallholder maize farming systems undergirded by the lack of capital for critical investments both at the farm and at national policy levels. Using a value chain approach, this diagnostic study explains how a complex configuration of actor interaction within an institutionally and agro-ecologically challenged value chain leads to the enduring absence of maize farming credit support. We find a cycle of credit rationing resulting from value chain challenges such as agro-ecological uncertainties, inadequate GAPs training, weak farmer groups and market insecurity. This condition is sustained by an interplay between mistrust, insufficient information across the value chain and inadequate control strategies in the maize credit system. We argue that Digital Platforms (DPs) show potential to help overcome some information and communication gaps and related uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangements. This is promising in terms of aiding awareness and coordinated responsiveness to agro-ecological farm conditions and the development of farming records databases. Thus, DPs could generate new networks and forms of cooperation in the maize value chain in this regard. As a tool for mediating trust in value chain credit cooperation, strategic use of these DP contributions could help initiate an entry point for recalibration of trust perceptions. Significant considerations and improvements are however needed to harness DPs effectively in mediating trust for maize credit provision, not least being farmer digital inclusion in DP implementation, effective intermediation and network governance arrangements and digital contributions towards cost-effective agro-ecological controls in the erratic maize farming context. This approach to trust building should therefore not be viewed as a quick fix but as a process of trial and error, and learning by doing.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.compag.2019.05.026},
	abstract = {In recent years, agricultural extension services in developing countries have increasingly introduced modern information and communication technologies (ICT)to deliver advice. But to realize efficiency gains, digital applications may need to address heterogeneous information needs by targeting agricultural advisory contents in a household-specific way. We explore the feasibility of an automated advisory service that collects household data from farmers, for example through the keypads of conventional mobile phones, and uses this data to prioritize agricultural advisory messages accordingly. To reduce attrition, such a system must avoid lengthy inquiry. Therefore, our objective was to identify a viable trade-off between low data requirements and useful household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages. At three sites in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania independently, we collected experimental preference rankings from smallholder farmers for receiving information about different agricultural and livelihood practices. At each site, we identified socio-economic household variables that improved model-based predictions of individual farmers’ information preferences. We used the models to predict household-specific rankings of information options based on 2–4 variables, requiring the farmer to answer between 5 and 10 questions through an ICT interface. These predicted rankings could inform household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages in a digital agro-advisory application. Household-specific “top 3” options suggested by the models were better-fit to farmers’ preferences than a random selection of 3 options by 48–68\%, on average. The analysis shows that relatively limited data inputs from farmers, in a simple format, can be used to increase the client-orientation of ICT-mediated agricultural extension. This suggests that household-specific prioritization of agricultural advisory messages through digital two-way communication is feasible. In future digital agricultural advisory applications, collecting little data from farmers at each interaction may feed into learning algorithms that continuously improve the targeting of advice.},

This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the broader BXW problem using a systems perspective, with the aim to add to the understanding about reasons for poor uptake of appropriate disease management practices, and limited ability to prevent rather than control BXW in the region. We comprehensively describe and analyse the various problem dimensions, and determine relations with data, information, knowledge, and connectivity.

The study utilised a cross-sectional survey of a randomly selected sample of 116 KyD farmers in KwaZulu-Natal Province. A Logit model was used to analyse the data. The results show that more farmers are aware of farmgate market channels, but however, they tended to utilise auction market channels. Furthermore, gender, marital status, educational level, employment status, farm income, source of income, herd size, labour and training were significant variables in the awareness and use of butcheries, auctions and farm gate markets. The study concludes that the scheme is particularly effective in influencing commercialisation through utilisation of more lucrative market channels such as auctions. Furthermore, socio-economic factors had a bearing on the awareness and use of marketing channels for smallholder farmers in the KyD scheme. Labour was particularly significant across butchery, auction and farm gate market channels. The study recommends that the scheme needs to improve awareness and use of market channels through utilisation of information platforms such as radio, television and direct communication though mobile phones. Furthermore, extension should assist farmers not only in awareness of markets, but also in the utilisation of those markets.},

	abstract = {Smallholder irrigation expansion would significantly increase agricultural production, and reduce food insecurity and poverty levels in East Africa. This paper reviews literature on trends, constraints and opportunities of smallholder irrigation in four East African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Irrigation development has been slow in these countries, and has been mainly through traditional schemes. Recently, individual irrigation technologies such as small motorized pumps, drip kits, treadle pumps, rope and washer pumps are being promoted. Adoption of these technologies and expansion of smallholder irrigation however face a number of challenges including land tenure issues; lack of access to appropriate irrigation technologies, improved agricultural inputs, reliable markets, finance and credit services, and research support; poor transport and communication infrastructures; poor irrigation water management; poor extension systems; and the over dependence on national governments, NGOs and donors for support. Despite these challenges, opportunities exist for smallholder irrigation expansion in East Africa. Such opportunities include: high untapped irrigation potential; rainwater harvesting to improve water availability; high commitment of national governments, NGOs and donors to smallholder irrigation expansion; low cost irrigation technologies adaptable to local conditions; traditional schemes rehabilitation; growing urbanization; and increased use of mobile phones that can be used to disseminate information.},

	volume = {13},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0204014},
	abstract = {Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) provide guidance to policy makers, the private sector and consumers to redesign food systems and to improve diets of vulnerable populations. As appropriate FBDGs are based on the actual dietary patterns and their costs, it is assumed that the recommended foods are available, affordable and acceptable for the population under study. Using quantitative dietary intake data of young children in rural Northern Ghana, we developed local FBDGs and studied whether these are supported by the diversity and quantity of the production of a household among 329 households. We found that 40\% of rural Northern Ghanaian infants and young children were stunted and their nutrient intakes were far below the recommendations: the probability of adequacy for most nutrient intakes was less than 50\%. At household level, the developed FBDGs were, on average, unable to sufficiently cover the household requirements for fat (60.4\% of recommended nutrient intake (RNI)), calcium (34.3\% RNI), iron (60.3\% RNI), vitamin A (39.1\% RNI), vitamin B12 (2.3\% RNI) and vitamin C (54.6\% RNI). This implies that even when these FBDGs are fully adopted the requirements for these nutrients will not be met. In addition, the nutrient needs and food needs (according to the developed FBDGs) of a household were only marginally covered by their own food production. The food production of over half the households supplied insufficient calcium (75.7\%), vitamin A (100\%), vitamin B12 (100\%) and vitamin C (77.5\%) to cover their needs. The food production of about 60\% of the households did not cover their required quantities of grains and legumes and none covered their required quantities of vegetables. Further analysis of the food gaps at district and national level showed that sufficient grains were available at both levels (267\% and 148\%, respectively) to meet requirements; availability of legumes was sufficient at district level (268\%) but not at national level (52\%); and vegetables were insufficient at both levels (2\% and 49\%, respectively). Diversifying household food production is often proposed as a means to increase the diversity of foods available and thereby increasing dietary diversity of rural populations. We found that the diversity of the production of a household was indeed positively related with their food and nutrient coverage. However, the diversity of the production of a household and their food and nutrient coverage were not related with children’s dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy. Our results show that the production of a households does not support the adoption of FBDGs in rural Northern Ghana, especially for vegetables. This suggests that the promotion of FBDGs through nutrition education or behaviour change communications activities alone is insufficient to lead to improvements in diets. Additional strategies are needed to increase the food availability and accessibility of the households, especially that of fruits and vegetables, such as diversification of the crops grown, increased production of specific crops and market-based strategies.},

	abstract = {Agriculture continues to be the thrust of Uganda's economy, directly employing majority of the population. However, there is deficiency in extension service delivery with few trained extension workers to support smallholder farmers. As a result, there have been strides to revolutionize traditional agriculture extension delivery through Village Enterprise Agent Model using mobile telephony digital extension platform. A cross sectional study design was adopted using ethnographic interviews and survey questionnaire with 70 VEAs. The diffusion of innovation theory and technology acceptance model are applied to examine the VEAs' experience in using mobile telephony as a tool to deliver agriculture extension services. Explicitly, the study investigated the capacity of VEAs to deliver extension services, how they do it, the kind of information delivered and the challenges to this model. Study findings revealed that social networks of farmer groups are key diffusion channels through which VEAs reach smallholder farmers. Adopters' characteristics such as VEAs' education background, community leadership skills and prior experience in using mobile telephony has a strong bearing on the ease of disseminating digital messages to farmers. In addition, the Kulima mobile telephony digital platform has supported real time dissemination of agricultural information. This is integrated with pragmatic demonstration gardens, farmer exchange visits, home visits to enhance farmers' peer learning. The sustainability of VEA model, with no clear incentive system, amidst complicated agriculture terminologies used in digital messages are some of the challenges to the model. Thus, future extension delivery using community agents and information communication technology should be cognizant of the social cultural dynamics, social nodes and ties of farmers and translate mobile digital messages into indigenous languages.},

	doi = {10.3389/fvets.2019.00191},
	abstract = {The risks posed for disease introduction and spread are believed to be higher for smallholder livestock producers than commercial producers. Possible reasons for this is the notion that smallholders do not implement appropriate animal health management practices and are not part of traditional livestock communication networks. These factors contribute to the effectiveness of passive disease surveillance systems. A cross-sectional study, using a postal survey (n = 1,140) and group interviews (28 participants in three groups), was conducted to understand the animal health management and communication practices of smallholders keeping sheep, cattle, pigs, dairy goats and alpacas in Australia. These practices are crucial for an effective passive surveillance system. Findings indicate that there is a need for improvement in animal health management practices, such as contact with veterinarians and attitudes toward reporting. Results also indicate that these practices differ depending on the livestock species kept, with sheep ownership being associated with lower engagement with surveillance activities and smallholders keeping dairy goats and alpacas having in general better practices. Other factors associated with surveillance practices among participant smallholders are gender and years of experience raising livestock. Despite the differences observed, over 80\% of all smallholders actively seek information on the health of their livestock, with private veterinarians considered to be a trusted source. Emergency animal diseases are not a priority among smallholders, however they are concerned about the health of their animals. The finding that veterinarians were identified by producers to be the first point of contact in the event of unusual signs of disease, strengthens the argument that private veterinarians play a vital role in improving passive surveillance. Other producers are also a point of contact for animal health advice, with government agencies less likely to be contacted. The effectiveness of on-farm passive surveillance could be enhanced by developing strategies involving both private veterinarians and producers as key stakeholders, which aim to improve awareness of disease and disease reporting responsibilities.},

This research, conducted in 2016, sought to determine whether private extension providers are more effective than public extension as information sources for smallholder farmers. The specific objectives were to examine the effectiveness of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) use by public and private agricultural extension providers and to analyze statistically, the performances of public and private extension systems. A sample of 342 farmers drawn from a list of 2,365 rice growers registered with public and private offices in Gujranwala, the largest rice-producing district in Pakistan, were interviewed. The study found that extension agents in the private sector were less effective than the public sector, in communicating development messages to resource-poor farmers. However, the private sector was more effective in inputs distribution than the public sector.

	abstract = {The location of properties holding livestock is fluid; edging towards the boundaries of urban Australia, increasing the likelihood that veterinarians will be exposed to livestock as part of the provision of routine veterinary services. This study was conducted to ascertain the challenges, knowledge level and training needs of veterinarians working within this landscape, with the ultimate aim of informing the development of resources and training to better equip them in this capacity. For this purpose, a cross-sectional study, using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among Australian veterinarians. The questionnaire comprised a mixture of 47 short closed, semi-closed and open-ended questions and was available for electronic distribution. Data was analysed descriptively and logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential factors associated with knowledge and practices of veterinarians in relation to smallholders. Complete responses were obtained from 91 veterinarians. The main livestock species kept by smallholder clients were sheep, goats, and cattle; with on-farm visits reported the most frequent interaction type, and responding to emergency situations the most frequently performed activity. The challenges experienced by veterinarians when working with smallholders were mostly related to external factors such as; lack of facilities, lack of client knowledge on animal health management and client's financial constraints. Over 95\% of respondents provided some level of biosecurity advice and zoonotic disease information as part of their routine veterinary service. Although veterinarians provide advice and support to smallholders, only 14.5\% considered themselves to be highly influential on smallholder practices. Confidence level in investigating disease differed by livestock species, with lower confidence reported in pigs, poultry and alpaca. Respondents were open to receiving assistance to support smallholders on matters related to disease, welfare or biosecurity, with other veterinarians (government and private), reported as the most frequently utilised resource. Having access to materials that could be distributed to smallholders was considered to be an effective way in which to provide information. While the risk of zoonotic disease was considered a challenge associated with working with smallholders, respondent's use of personal protective equipment (PPE), whilst performing common veterinary activities, was in many instances inadequate. Similarly, vaccination levels among veterinarians and other workers within the veterinary practice to prevent zoonotic diseases were variable. This study provides an insight into the way in which veterinarians engage with smallholders and highlight the importance of providing both groups with the tools necessary to manage the livestock to which are exposed.},

	abstract = {The ability of smallholder farmers to utilise seasonal climate forecast (SCF) information in farm planning to reflect anticipated climate is a precursor to improved farm management. However, the integration of SCF by smallholder farmers into farm planning has been poor, partly because of the lack of forecast skill, lack of communication and inability to see the relevance of the SCFs for specific farming decisions. The relevance of seasonal climate forecasting in farming decisions can be enhanced through improved understanding of SCF from the smallholder farmers' perspective. Studies that have been done of how smallholder farmers understand SCF and how the available SCFs influence smallholder farmers' decisions are limited. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to review how smallholder farmers make decisions on farming practices based on SCFs and the challenges and opportunities thereof. The review shows that the majority of smallholder farmers in Africa make use of either scientific or indigenous knowledge climate forecasts and, in some cases, a combination of both. There are mixed results in the area of evaluating benefits of SCFs in decision-making and farm production. In some cases, the outcomes are positive, whereas in others they are difficult to quantify. Thus, the integration of SCFs into smallholder farmers' decision-making is still a challenge. We recommend that significant work must be done to improve climate forecasts in terms of format, and spatial and temporal context in order for them to be more useful in influencing decision-making by smallholder farmers. Significance: • At the farm level, making the right decisions at the right time is rendered even more difficult in light of the increasing frequency of extreme weather patterns. • The threat of climate change makes accurate seasonal climate forecasting essential for African smallholder farmers. • Technological, social and interdisciplinary issues, communication and scale are some key challenges which impact the utility and uptake of SCFs in rural smallholder farms. • The integration of both scientific and indigenous knowledge forecasts is an opportunity for further exploration.},

More so, mobile for development research uses quantitative methods which limits proper interrogation of real perceived social implications of mobile phones for livelihoods. Thus, this study, with a more qualitative approach, seeks to understand community narratives about the social implications of mobile phone usage for livelihood security. Findings suggest the increased penetration of small end phones, with few smartphones. Noticeable social benefits include improved communication, financial inclusion, employment opportunities, increased business and market opportunities, increased access to information sharing and improved literacy practices. Conclusively, access to learning on mobile phones was an outstanding social benefit, amidst the presence of negative and dissenting voices about mobile phone use, fully embedded in cultural and religious beliefs within societies.},

	abstract = {Timely and relevant information to farmers at right time improve agricultural productivity. The importance of ICT to connect farmers with the information they need has received much attention. Rapid, efficient, and cost effective knowledge management can be achieved by ICT. However, application of ICT in knowledge management in Ethiopia is low when compared with several African countries. Various factors are determining ICT usage in agriculture by smallholder farmers. Hence, the study was carried out to identify the factors determining ICT usage in agriculture by smallholder farmers in the Tiyo District, Arsi Zone. Sample magnitude was resolute using the formula provided by Yamane. From the selected three kebeles, 146 smallholder farmers were selected using stratified random sampling technique. Quantitative data was collected through survey using semi-structured interview schedule. Qualitative data was collected through focus group discussion, key informant interview and observation. It was found through inferential statistic tests that the factors namely, family size, distance to mobile service centre, land size, economic motivation, cosmo politeness were having non-significant relationship with ICT usage. Access to personal credit and ICT facility in FTC were constant. There was no access to personal credit for all respondents and absence of ICT facility in FTC for respondents in general. Therefore, these above-mentioned factors were not included in the model. Binary logistic regression analysis indicates that total annual income, possession of radio and television shows positive significant relationship whereas age shows negative relationship with ICT usage. Hence, the Ethiopian public extension system should concentrate more on designing radio and television programs for the transfer of technology. The government owned television channels also allocate more time for agricultural programs on fixed timings convenient to the farmers.},

Achieving SI requires smallholder farmers to have access to information that is context-specific, increases their decision-making capacities, and adapts to changing environments. Current extension services often struggle to address these needs. New mobile phone-based services can help. In order to enhance the public extension service in Tanzania, we created a digital service that addresses smallholder farmers’ different information needs for implementing SI. Using a co-design methodology–User-Centered Design–we elicited feedback from farmers and extension agents in Tanzania to create a new digital information service, called Ushauri. This automated hotline gives farmers access to a set of pre-recorded messages. Additionally, farmers can ask questions in a mailbox. Extension agents then listen to these questions through an online platform, where they record and send replies via automated push-calls. A test with 97 farmers in Tanzania showed that farmers actively engaged with the service to access agricultural advice. Extension agents were able to answer questions with reduced workload compared to conventional communication channels. This study illustrates how User-Centered Design can be used to develop information services for complex and resource-restricted smallholder farming contexts.},

Binary logistic regression was used to analyze data collected from 100 farmers in the citrus regions of Beni Khalled and Menzel Bouzelfa, to identify determining factors for farmers’ willingness to accept the proposed water management strategies. Empirical findings reveal that the significant explanatory variables are essentially linked to farmer satisfaction about the current irrigation management in relation to water supply reliability, rather than the social criteria and farmers’ awareness of water scarcity. More efforts are needed to improve the transparency of water allocation systems to motivate the willingness of water users to adopt new technologies or policies. The different stakeholders should agree to take action now about strategic extension and communication plans to enhance awareness on ensuing environmental problems, to take advantage of long-term profitability of the water restriction.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of an extension system referred to its ability to meet the farmer needs in providing the new technology which suits to their conditions and results in better production. Recently the demand for information on agricultural practices and technology among the farmers is increasing day by day but fulfilment of these demands exclusively by public agricultural extension system is limited. To address this challenge, information communication technology (ICT) has the immense role in supplementing the extension system. Among the ICT tools, mobile phone, because of its affordability, accessibility, minimum skill requirement, widespread network etc., has emerged as important tool for information and knowledge dissemination to the smallholder and marginal farmers. But it is necessary to study how effective they are in achieving the respective objectives.The present investigation was conducted to study the effectiveness of mKRISHI ® PAWS (Personalised Advisory on Water and Soil) in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand state. An ex-post facto research design was used for this study. Total 136 messages were sent to the respondents. The data was collected from 240 beneficiary farmers of the north-western Himalayan region. The effectiveness of the mKRISHI® PAWS in technology advisory and delivery services were measured by developing an effectiveness index for the purpose. Results showed that 93.8\% of farmers perceive that quality of information regarding the latest NRM technologies in soil and water conservation was excellent and 83.75\% of the farmers felt that the information regarding the latest NRM technologies in soil and water conservation was appropriate to their condition. The study revealed that the extension services delivered by mKRISHI ® PAWS were found to be highly effective by majority of the farmers. 34.58\% farmers perceived that the mKRISHI ® PAWS was very highly effective as a mean of getting their information needs.},

	doi = {10.1108/JWL-12-2017-0115},
	abstract = {Purpose: Ethiopia operates a large agricultural extension service system. However, access to extension-related knowledge, technologies and agricultural inputs is unequally distributed among smallholder farmers. Social learning is widely practiced by most farmers to cope with this unequal distribution though its practices have hardly been documented in passing on knowledge of agriculture and rural development or embedding it into the local system of knowledge production, transfer and use. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to identify the different methods of social learning, as well as their contribution to the adoption and diffusion of technologies within Ethiopia’s smallholder agricultural setting. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methods approach was used, comprising farmer and expert interviews, focus group discussions, informal individual discussions and key informant interviews. The data were documented, coded and later analyzed using SPSS and ATLAS.ti. Findings: The findings showed that 55 per cent of the farmers in the studied areas fully relied on social, community-level learning to adopt agricultural technologies, while 35 per cent of them relied on social learning only partly. Farmers acquired knowledge through social networks by means of communication, observation, collective labor groups, public meetings, socio-cultural events and group socialization. Informal institutions such as iddir, debo and dado, helped farmers learn, adopt and diffuse technologies. Originality/value: This study used the concept of epistemic oppression by Dotson (2014) as a conceptual framework to examine farmers’ access to extension services and to analyze how informal institutions serve as workplace learning for the smallholder farmers. The authors suggest community-level social learning serves as a coping mechanism against the prevailing limitations of the formal extension system, and at the same time, it guards against the deepening of social, political and epistemic inequalities that are inherent to the knowledge system.},

	abstract = {Information sharing is an important pillar for any strategy that aims to control infectious diseases especially in farms and systems that are connected. A study was designed to analyze practices related to sharing of animal health information and identify health constraints affecting livestock keeping in smallholder farming systems of Mwala in Machakos County. Data were collected through focus group discussions (number of groups = 3) and one-on-one questionnaire interviews (n = 172). These were analyzed using both descriptive and thematic approaches. The most (33\%; n = 158) feared animal disease was pneumonia which was also the most (62\%) frequently reported health problem. Rabies, Newcastle disease, and east coast fever were ranked high by the farmer groups. Current animal management practices, for example, failure to confine dogs, predispose the community to a number of health risks including bites from rabid animals. Smallholder farmers in Mwala utilize a number of options to communicate animal health problems; such sharing is, however, constrained by a number of factors including bad roads, poor coverage of mobile networks, and bad relationships between animal health providers and the farmers themselves. Some of the reasons why farmers delay the reporting of disease problems included the tendency for one to first try local herbal formulations, the bad times when cases are observed, and the unavailability of reliable animal health providers at the time when the farmers need them. This study has provided useful baseline data that can then be used to (1) design a village-based animal disease reporting system which is currently lacking in the surveyed villages and (2) support the county government’s efforts to manage animal diseases including zoonoses, through better reporting, for improved health, nutrition, and livelihoods.},

However, direct sales to individual smallholders remains a challenging task without an easily scalable solution. The current research seeks to find the determinants of adoption of a stand-alone coffee index-based insurance product in Uganda marketed by a farmer cooperative, and elicited preferences for improving the design and delivery model. A stratified household survey was conducted among 614 farmers, of which 40\% adopted insurance and 62\% were member of a farmer cooperative. In odds ratio terms, adopters perceived themselves to be 3.09 times more likely to receive a pay-out than non-adopters (P{\textless}0.01), and those having better access to extension services were 2.47 times more likely to adopt a policy (P{\textless}0.01). Yet farmers perceiving the design as complex were approximately half as likely to adopt (P{\textless}0.05). Farmers preferred the option of premium payments proceeds on delivery, mobile premium payments and deliver-ing insurance through cooperatives/associations. Deepening insurance uptake among coffee farmers will therefore require a strong focus on communication and information sharing facilitated by cooperatives/associations (e.g. farmer cooperates, village and saving associations, or women’s associations).},

	abstract = {The ongoing expansion of global trade and human mobility are causing increased occurrences of biosecurity outbreaks, particularly of invasive pests which threaten biodiversity and agricultural production. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable, as they are generally not well-prepared for such incursions. In Australia, farmers with non-English speaking backgrounds are more likely to be influenced by these increasing risks and may need long-term adaptive support. Understanding farmers’ perceptions of biosecurity threats, and what drives these perceptions, is a prerequisite for designing effective biosecurity management policies to support livelihoods and food security. In this study, we aim to understand the perceptions of smallholder farmers’ on biosecurity threats and the factors influencing their perceptions. Data was obtained from a survey of 101 Vietnamese farmers across three geographically dispersed locations in Australia (Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia). Using the Protection Motivation Theory, we found that 43\% of farmers perceived biosecurity threats to be one of the key agricultural risks, preceded by weather-related risk (48\%) and produce price fluctuations (45\%). Belief in the existence of biosecurity threats and the sources of information on biosecurity matters had a significant positive influence on farmers’ overall perceptions of biosecurity threats on four dimensions of their life. English levels had a significant influence on their perceptions of biosecurity threats on crop output whereas farm size, gender, and farmers’ age did not significantly affect farmers’ overall perceptions of biosecurity threats. The findings of this study could be used by government agencies and industry associations to better target support for farmers to minimise the threats of pest and disease incursions. Support could be delivered through the introduction of relevant extension services and education programs with more transparent and direct communications of risk and compliances, improving farmers’ knowledge and belief in biosecurity and fostering trust between farmers and the government.},

	abstract = {Climate change is an environmental process that is among the most limiting factors for increasing or even maintaining food production by small-farmer communities in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Adoption of climate change adaptation strategies that increase agricultural productivity and at the same time building farmers’ resilience capacity has become a top policy priority in SSA. In this study, we investigate how maize-dependent smallholders in Ethiopia adapt to climate change. Both household and plot-level data were collected, and subsequently analysed by a multivariate probit regression model. Results show that most climate change adaptation strategies implemented by maize-dependent smallholders, are complementary. Combining conservation tillage, mixed maize-legume cropping and terracing along with the use of drought-resistant maize varieties allows farmers to increase productivity while building resilience to climate change more than a subset of these strategies. Findings indicate that the likelihood of adopting soil and water conservation practices, drought-resistant maize varieties and chemical fertilizers significantly increase among young and male-headed households as well as farmers having confidence in extension agents and membership in local organisations. Hence, policies should aim at further building agricultural extension agents’ capacity by providing effective and continuous education and training on climate change impacts and responses. Promoting family ties and household memberships in local organisations through facilitating mutual cooperation and communication among farming communities would help to foster adoption of climate change adaptation strategies.},

In order to fill the knowledge gap in the subject, this chapter interrogates some agronomic practices of farm youths who are a critical stakeholder in the informal economy. One hundred and twenty selfidentified smallholder farm youths were selected through a multistage sampling procedure. A validated interview schedule was used to elicit information on the youths’ awareness of and involvement in a set of pro-green economy agronomic practices that generate environmental amenities and increase economic growth via increased yield. Research findings showed that the average income of the respondents was US\$1097 ( NGN397, 931.56) per annum. The average farm size was 6.1 acres. The respondents were more aware of and involved in mulching relative to other nine agronomic practices identified in the study. Whereas culture was indicated as an insignificant constraint to the youths’ involvement, unavailability of credit facilities, lack of market opportunity, scarcity of information on the agronomic practices, and limited access to extension services were ranked as the major constraints. The chapter concluded that the improvement in the content and sources of communication and provision of input-supports through government’s ecological program for the farm youths would perhaps increase the youths’ involvement in the enhancement of an agriculture-supported green economy.},

	doi = {10.18697/AJFAND.84.BLFB1007},
	abstract = {Agriculture is the backbone of many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, lack of efficient extension systems to support agricultural development is widely seen as a missing link in agricultural transformation in the region. International development agencies have in the past four decades invested heavily in various extension models such as the Training and Visit and Farmer Field School systems in order to enhance the performance of extension workers. Despite such investments, the performance of extension agents does remain suboptimal in many contexts. Studies in other sectors show that incentivizing worker performance through nudges such as incentive realignment schemes that tie worker performance to a pay/bonus system could enhance worker productivity. However, there is a lack of incentive realignment studies that estimate the performance of extension agents in sub-Saharan Africa. A potential hindrance to the application of such scheme to extension is the absence of monitoring mechanisms to track the performance of extension agents who often work across diverse local contexts to reach smallholder farmers with extension advice. This study empirically estimates the effect of an information communication technology (ICT)-based payment incentive system that tracks the performance of extension workers in rural Uganda. It undertakes a quasi-experimental ex-post impact assessment of a payment incentive realignment as an exogenous shift in the price of labor for extension services by Ugandan Community Knowledge Workers (CKWs) in 2011. This study applies a difference-in-difference with propensity score matching technique to estimate the effect of an ICT-based incentive re-alignment scheme in 2011, on the performance of 461 CKWs in rural Uganda. The study shows that CKWs in rural Uganda respond positively to an ICT-based performance incentive scheme that affects the price of labor. Results suggest that such performance systems can enhance the productivity of CKWs - an exemplar of rural extension agents in Uganda and elsewhere in developing countries. It also finds that younger CKWs respond more productively to higher incentives than their older counterparts. Therefore, the study suggests that extension policies that tie extension agents' performance to ICT-based payment incentives could enhance their performance and contribute towards the sustainable developments goals on food security, among others, through multiplier effects.},

Current approaches to geographic information dissemination to smallholders, such as the rural extension model, are limited, yet advancements in internet and communication technologies (ICTs) could help augment these processes through the provision of agricultural geographic information (AGI) directly to farmers. We analysed recent ICT initiatives for communicating climate and agriculture-related information to smallholders for improved livelihoods and climate change adaptation. Through the critical analysis of initiatives, we identified opportunities for the success of future AGI developments. We systematically examined 27 AGI initiatives reported in academic and grey literature (e.g., organisational databases). Important factors identified for the success of initiatives include affordability, language(s), community partnerships, user collaboration, high quality and locally-relevant information through low-tech platforms, organisational trust, clear business models, and adaptability. We propose initiatives should be better-targeted to deliver AGI to regions in most need of climate adaptation assistance, including SE Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Further assessment of the most effective technological approaches is needed. Initiatives should be independently assessed for evaluation of their uptake and success, and local communities should be better-incorporated into the development of AGI initiatives.},

Informants approved the use of video as an important extension service delivery tool in equipping farmers with the necessary knowledge and skills that are key in influencing change in rice production practices and technologies. Video also triggers discussions among participants during and after the show through various knowledge sharing mechanisms with serious implications on change in production practices and technologies.

We propose that large-scale participatory approaches, combined with innovations in information and communications technology (ICT), could enable the effective matching of diverse options to the wide spectrum of socio-ecological context that characterize smallholder agriculture. We consider the requirements, precedents and issues that might be involved in the development of farmer research networks (FRNs). Substantial institutional innovation will be needed to support FRNs, with shifts in roles and relationships amongst researchers, extension providers and farmers. Where farmers' organizations have social capital and strong facilitation skills, such alignments may be most feasible. Novel information management capabilities will be required to introduce options and principles, enable characterization of contexts, manage data related to option-by-context interactions and enable farmers to visualize their findings in useful and intelligible ways. FRNs could lead to vastly greater capacity for technical innovation, which could in turn enable greater productivity and resilience, and enhance the quality of rural life.},

Farmers’ preferences of communication media in receiving agricultural innovations should be prioritised to improve agricultural communication and subsequently, productivity, which is dire in Zimbabwe in the light of the continuing food insecurity. The findings indicated that farmers prefer media that are stimulating and engaging such as television and demonstrations; convenient such as mobile phones and detailed such as books probably because the majority of them do not have training in agriculture. Demographic variables of age-group and education were found to be associated with communication preferences of some media. The study has implications for agricultural communication media policy. Beyond prioritisation of farmers’ preferences, a model of a multi-media approach to agricultural communication has been developed, that could widen communication reach if implemented.},

With the intention of developing more democratic processes of knowledge production to support innovation processes, five smallholder farmer groups were invited to apply for action funds to co-develop innovations to enhance livelihoods. Employing participatory video (PV), groups applied for the grants using a ‘video proposal’. Group members collaboratively produced videos representing their problems, aims and innovation plans. Key findings around group empowerment are presented and reflected upon with regard to the different modalities of “power-to”, “power-with”, “power-within” and “power-over”. The PV proposal process proved to be a good tool for supporting farmer group capacity building and the development of competencies in relation to farmers' rural innovation projects. The process enhanced farmer groups’ “power-to” in terms of planning capacities. This fostered motivation for action and a sense of collective ownership; thus building “power-with” at the group level. The understanding of power mobilised in this paper enabled us to highlight some context-specific limitations to democratising research relationships and creating more inclusive spaces for participatory action research and rural innovation development. These are related to entrenched socio-cultural power dynamics within the groups and to possibilities to sustain the empowerment process beyond the duration of the project. Nevertheless, funding agencies and local rural development organisations could consider the method discussed in this paper as a valuable tool for assisting marginalised groups in accessing innovation funds.},

	abstract = {In Africa, many governments and development agencies have promoted aquaculture as a panacea for household food security, rural development, and poverty reduction. However, aquaculture production in the continent remains low despite significant investments in research and technology development. While numerous initiatives have been directed at technological innovation and transfer, their present scale of uptake is very slow and therefore inadequate to achieve transformational change envisaged in the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. In this paper, we aim to (1) critically analyze the factors that influence fish farmer’s perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward technology adoption; and (2) to determine the impacts of technology adoption on farmer’s livelihoods. Primary data were collected using a self-administered digitized questionnaire to 331 randomly selected farmers in Kenya. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze data. Results revealed that variables including secondary education, diversified on-farm activities, farm size, production levels, attendance of extension training, ease of understanding, and ease of handling technologies were positive and significant predictors of aquaculture technology adoption. However, 30\% of fish farmers were categorized as high adopters of novel aquaculture technologies, implying that there are gaps in technical skills hindering adoption of innovative technologies and best management practices. To facilitate learning and uptake of technologies and good practices by farmers, a range of aquaculture-related extension and communication materials, including posters, hard copy information leaflets and brochures of recipes in appropriate languages, short video presentations, and radio features, should be commissioned to support the smallholder farmers.},

	abstract = {This article explores how conflict-induced displacement influences agricultural innovation processes and systems, and its implications after the return home or permanent resettlement of smallholder farmers. Results show that high rates of agricultural innovation occurred during displacement in the Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005), many of which were maintained afterwards. Respondents cited the need for adaptation to new social and physical circumstances, changed gender roles, and enhanced inter-household communication as contributing to increased opportunities for knowledge exchange, trade, and importantly, the development of new networks, modes of organisation and social norms. Furthermore, returnees to South Sudan have embodied these changes together with new values, habits and expectations. New linkages continued across borders between returnees and non-returnees, facilitating knowledge exchange and access to resources, markets and sources of ideas. A high degree of autonomous innovation capacity was also evident. Further research is required on the dynamics and processes associated with innovation in conflict-induced displacement. It is important for policy makers to encourage approaches that seek to actively tap into and build on the institutional, human and social capital built during displacement.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.03.004},
	abstract = {The aquaculture sector in Bangladesh is an important employer and a significant source of foreign exchange. In addition, it contributes significantly to food security due to the role of fish in peoples’ diets, the most important source of protein and micronutrients. However, infectious diseases represent an important barrier to sector development due to economic losses and vulnerability of smallholders. The aim of this study was to gain an overview of the impact of infectious diseases in the aquaculture sector, and to assess the usefulness and use of impact studies in decision making for animal health management and biosecurity governance in Bangladesh. A review of scientific and grey literature on infectious disease impact in different aquaculture systems was conducted and their methodologies and findings summarised. Subsequently, interviews with 28 stakeholders from the private and public sector were conducted to enquire about decision-making structures in animal health management. The data were analysed using the framework method to allow the development of themes, by using the information, experiences and opinions inductively obtained from interviewees, deductively through the reviewed literature. Results showed a substantial socio-economic impact of infectious diseases. The numerous stakeholders involved in the decision-making process explained that key barriers to effective aquaculture health management were insufficient resources to investigate and tackle infectious aquatic animal diseases, a dearth of legislation and capacity for disease surveillance, a reliance on reactive response, and a lack of impact and evidence-based approaches for prioritising problem-solving, commonly based on anecdotal evidence. Furthermore, communication among the multiple stakeholders involved was reported to be weak. This complex situation requires a multi-level response, which should span from strengthening the knowledge of farmers and professionals in the field to the improvement of surveillance and diagnostic systems. Improved systems along with evidence on disease impact could inform the prioritisation of diseases and resource allocation for disease control in Bangladesh. Further, this evidence needs to be used to advise decisions to have a true value, for which establishing and strengthening communication pathways and processes is critical to make systematic use of the information and improve animal health management. In the light of future threats to Bangladesh such as climate change, increasing population density and demand for animal source foods, it is crucial to strengthen animal health management systems to reduce livelihoods vulnerability, food insecurity and the likelihood of disease emergence.},

	abstract = {In August 2015, a rabies outbreak occurred in bovines in a Punjab village, India; subsequently, a farmer in the same village died of rabies in October 2015. We surveyed farmers to describe the outbreak, the demographics and rabies prophylaxis administered to householders on case farms, and farmers’ knowledge of rabies prevention and treatment. We used multiple correspondence analysis to guide investigation of associations between demographics, farm status and rabies knowledge, attitudes and practices. The number of affected bovines was unusually high; 15 cattle and buffalo died on 13 smallholder farms (attack rate 4\%). Post-exposure vaccinations were administered to 24 people (median 2 doses). Affected farms had significantly larger households and were more likely to keep their livestock outside (therefore, accessible by stray dogs), suggesting that the impact of the outbreak was disproportionally borne by households of lower socio-economic status. Primary sources of rabies information were friends and neighbours, not health authorities or media. Women who had not received formal education were less likely to have heard of rabies. Although case farm participants were more likely to have heard about rabies from a veterinarian, their knowledge and practices to prevent rabies did not reflect the level expected considering their contact with a health professional; they were more likely to believe that traditional remedies prevent rabies and less likely to tell their children to avoid playing with stray dogs than participants from other farms. This study highlights knowledge dissemination disparities that, if typical of rural locations, could obstruct attempts to eliminate canine-mediated human rabies in India. Therefore, understanding the pervasiveness and influence of traditional medical beliefs on treatment-seeking behaviour, communication structures within villages and the impact of local practices such as carcass disposal on dog populations will be essential to ensure that rabies control strategies are effective in rural India.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the successful engagement of local stakeholders in the implementation and evaluation process of improved cooking stoves; a technology that improves food security in two climatically contrasting regions in Tanzania. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment tool was used to conduct impact assessments on firewood-based improved cooking stoves to evaluate their contribution to food security at local stakeholder level. Between 2014 and 2017, four annual impact assessments were conducted with local stakeholders in four villages in the semi-arid Dodoma and the sub-humid Morogoro regions to assess the impact of improved cooking stoves on locally defined nine food security criteria. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment was used to (i) ex-ante identify the expected impact, and (ii) to ex-post assess the experienced impact of improved cooking stoves on the nine food security criteria. The impact assessments showed that the perceived contribution of improved cooking stoves towards the food security criteria was positive throughout all assessments. In particular, improved cooking stoves addressed relevant food security criteria such as social relations, food availability, and market participation. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment tool supported continuous knowledge exchange between scientists and local stakeholders, thus improving communication and co-learning; while identifying merits and demerits of the improved cooking stoves that could be addressed during the project lifetime.},

	doi = {10.1108/JFBM-09-2018-0048},
	abstract = {Purpose: Family farms, in which business and family life are intricately interwoven, offer an interesting context for better understanding the interdependence between the family and business system. Many family farms struggle to survive, and the succession process is a key period in which the low returns on investment become evident but also the emotional attachment of the family to the farm and the willingness to transfer the business to the next generation. We take the perspective of non-succeeding siblings since they are crucial for a successful succession but their role and position in this process is far from clear. This study will help to increase our knowledge of how fairness is perceived by non-successors and of the impact of perceived (in)justice on the family business system. Design/methodology/approach: To analyze the effect on sibling relationships of an unequal outcome of the succession process, we choose the family farm context. We used interview data from multiple family members from several family farms in the Netherlands in different stages of succession. We utilized a framework based on justice theory to analyze perceptions of fairness among non-succeeding siblings. The central research question for this study is as follows: How do non-succeeding siblings perceive justice with regard to family firm succession? Findings: The acceptance of the outcomes of the succession process by non-succeeding siblings is influenced by their perception of the fairness of the process itself and decisions made by the incumbent and successor with regard to these outcomes. It seems that stakeholders who occupy multiple roles with conflicting justice perspectives handle these contradictions with the help of an overarching goal—in this study, preserving the continuity of the family farm—and by prioritizing and adjusting the justice perspectives accordingly. The findings further show that both distributive justice and procedural justice are important and interact with each other. Originality/value: Our study contributes to the literature by applying the theoretical framework of distributive and procedural justice to the context of family farm succession. This helps us to understand the position of non-succeeding siblings and their role and position in the succession process, which is important because sibling relationships have a significant impact on family harmony, with potential consequences for the business as well.},

	abstract = {A survey was conducted to identify management information sources and communication channels used by commercially oriented smallholder beef cattle producers (n = 62) in Limpopo province, South Africa. A total of 62 commercially oriented smallholder farmers under the Limpopo Industrial Development Corporation-Nguni cattle project were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data on farmers’ demographic and farm characteristics, sources of information and communication channels used. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to evaluate factors that influenced farmers’ choices of information sources and communications channels used. Findings show that government extension (53\% of the respondents) and other farmers (30\%) were the major sources of management information for the farmers. Based on the logistic regression results, the decision to choose government extension as the main source of information was mainly influenced by respondents’ gender (p = 0.001) and access to training (p = 0.023). Communication was mainly through farm-to-farm visits (56\%) and the use of mobile phones (30\%). Based on the current findings, the infusion of modern information communication technologies such as mobile phone-based innovations with the existing government extension service could further strengthen the capacity of farmers to share information among themselves as well as providing feedback to extension agents. Furthermore, it is essential to take cognizance of farmers’ socio-economic factors when identifying and characterizing their management information sources and communication strategies.},

Ordering effects are eliminated by warming up subjects in advance and using information disclosure. This paper uses the inferred attribute non-attendance method to process attributes ignored by the grain family farms and analyzes grain family farms’ preferences for different support policies with a mixed logit model and then uses a latent class model to analyze how the characteristics of grain family farms relate to different preference types. We find that grain family farms have a strong preference for agricultural subsidies, credit support, and technical support (the mean coefficient is greater than 0.8). Moreover, the preferences of grain family farms over the policy communication channel (the mean coefficient is greater than 0.5) cannot be ignored. Faced with the same policy attribute combination, grain family farms with high education levels, reasonable scales of operation, and good understanding of support policies are more likely to improve their profit margins. There are four preference types of grain family farms: finance preference (43.2\%), knowledge and technology preference (28.5\%), land transfer preference (15.4\%), and policy information preference (12.9\%).},

	abstract = {Wheat rust diseases pose one of the greatest threats to global food security, including subsistence farmers in Ethiopia. The fungal spores transmitting wheat rust are dispersed by wind and can remain infectious after dispersal over long distances. The emergence of new strains of wheat rust has exacerbated the risks of severe crop loss. We describe the construction and deployment of a near real-time early warning system (EWS) for two major wind-dispersed diseases of wheat crops in Ethiopia that combines existing environmental research infrastructures, newly developed tools and scientific expertise across multiple organisations in Ethiopia and the UK. The EWS encompasses a sophisticated framework that integrates field and mobile phone surveillance data, spore dispersal and disease environmental suitability forecasting, as well as communication to policy-makers, advisors and smallholder farmers. The system involves daily automated data flow between two continents during the wheat season in Ethiopia. The framework utilises expertise and environmental research infrastructures from within the cross-disciplinary spectrum of biology, agronomy, meteorology, computer science and telecommunications. The EWS successfully provided timely information to assist policy makers formulate decisions about allocation of limited stock of fungicide during the 2017 and 2018 wheat seasons. Wheat rust alerts and advisories were sent by short message service and reports to 10 000 development agents and approximately 275 000 smallholder farmers in Ethiopia who rely on wheat for subsistence and livelihood security. The framework represents one of the first advanced crop disease EWSs implemented in a developing country. It provides policy-makers, extension agents and farmers with timely, actionable information on priority diseases affecting a staple food crop. The framework together with the underpinning technologies are transferable to forecast wheat rusts in other regions and can be readily adapted for other wind-dispersed pests and disease of major agricultural crops.},

Farmer participatory research (FPR) is an important approach to help ensure relevance and define locally adapted solutions for enhanced adoption of sustainable agriculture (SA) technologies. The mother and baby trial (MBT) design has proved effective as a FPR approach to address challenges on smallholder farms. The MBT systematically links long-term “mother” trials, where slow and erratic processes can be monitored, to “baby” trials led by farmers to capture a wide range of farm practices and environmental contexts. Communication and learning is facilitated through MBTs as well. This distributed FPR approach documents the performance of technologies in diverse contexts and provides multiple opportunities for joint planning, observation, and reflection. We describe two MBT case studies, one within a developing country context (Malawi) and the other representing a novel application of MBT within an intensive agriculture context (Michigan). To explore tradeoffs in SA performance, multiple domains (productivity, environmental, and economic) are presented via radar charts as a visualization tool. In both FPR experiences, farmer perspectives and a wide range of practices were revealed. In Malawi, a mesic site was associated with steep SA tradeoffs compared with a marginal site. In Michigan, diversity in tillage practices, field crop performance, and soil health were found to be conditioned by the environment. Overall, the MBT approach supported the development of SA technologies adapted to local conditions.},

Recently telecommunication sector of Pakistan has launched farm advisory services for reaching farmers’ information needs. This paper analyzed the telecom sector’s mobile-based farm advisory services (mFAS) by exploring, provided content, farmers’ use, experiences, and its associated factors using the Likert scale and bivariate Probit regression. The study employed a multistage random sampling technique to collect data from the smallholders of Muzaffargarh district of Pakistan. Findings revealed that 70\% of the respondents were subscribed to mFAS. Results further indicated a vast gap between the farmers’ access and practical use of provided information in which weather forecast reported the most, while market updates reported the least utilization gap. Similarly, reduced transportation cost was ranked the most, while avoiding potential crop damages was ranked as the least perceived indicators of effectiveness. The study further reported one-way communication mode and farmers’ limited skills of mobile phone use as the major constraint in the use of the services. The results of the Probit model found a significant positive relation of farmers’ education, credit utilization, and educated family members, while a significant negative relation of farmers’ age with the use of mFAS. Based on findings, this study highlights the need for an interactive communication mode, context-specific advisory services, and farmers’ training and education for the successful utilization of these services.},

	abstract = {Ensuring food security has become a challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to combined effects of climate change, high population growth, and relying on rainfed farming. Governments are establishing shared irrigation infrastructure for smallholder farmers as part of the solutions for food security. However, the irrigated farms often failed to achieve the expected crop yield. This is partly due to lack of water management system in the irrigation infrastructure. In this work, IoT-based irrigation management system is proposed after investigating problems of irrigated farmlands in three SSA countries, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa as case studies. Resource-efficient IoT architecture is developed that monitors soil, microclimate and water parameters and performs appropriate irrigation management. Indigenous farming and expert knowledge, regional weather information, crop and soil specific characteristics are also provided to the system for informed-decision making and efficient operation of the irrigation management system. In SSA, broadband connectivity and cloud services are either unavailable or expensive. To tackle these limitations, data processing, network management, irrigation decisions and communication to the farmers are carried out locally, without the involvement of any back-end servers. Furthermore, the use of green energy sources and resource-aware intelligent data analysis algorithm is studied. It is expected that an intelligent data analysis will help to discover new knowledge that support further development of agricultural expertise. The proposed IoT-based irrigation management system is expected to contribute towards long term and sustainable high crop yield with minimum resource consumption and impact to the biodiversity around the case farmlands.},

It uses a qualitative approach based on focus group discussions in three villages with smallholder farmers and agricultural extension officers to build a theory of change. Results suggest that providing smallholder farmers with weather-related information has the potential to help them in taking informed production decisions. In doing so, smallholder farmers can better allocate their production resources and eventually record higher yield and income. The ultimate impact is that smallholder farmers will have better lives (i.e. livelihoods). There are several types of weather-related information that can be useful for farmers. There are also several dissemination channels. Some are based on local social networks and others on information and communication technologies. Each channel has strengths and weaknesses and the best or optimal dissemination approach would probably depend on the setting of the intervention area. A number of assumptions need to be in place for an impactful intervention. For instance, weather-related information needs to be accurate, available in a timely manner and easy to use. The described possible impact pathways need to be tested rigorously through policy-oriented research.},

	abstract = {Palm oil expansion in tropical forest margins captures headlines, primarily out of concern that encroachment to tropical forest causes environmental problem and ignites social issues [1]. Sustainability has to be understood in the wider context of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), rather than as primarily a plot-level ecological concern about persistence of production, to make sense of the debate that has become a very polarized and find ways forward. Cascading ecological and social issues have caused a loss of trust, (threats of) consumer boycotts and multiple standards and certification responses. Diverse sustainability issues have come up as part of a public issue-attention cycle with five recognisable stages [2]: A) Agenda setting, B) Better and widely shared understanding of what is at stake, C) Commitment to common principles, D) Details of devils derailing operations, devolved to (newly created or existing) formal institutions that handle implementation and associated budgets, and E) Efforts to monitor and evaluate effects. In Indonesia two phases of new establishment of palm oil coexist within a forest transition gradient: (i) (industry-led) expansion into new forest margins with many social and ecological consequences; and (ii) (often farmer-led) conversion of existing agroforestry and tree crop (often rubber-based) or pasture economies in mosaic landscapes. External consumer concerns refer to the expansion phase, rather than to production sustainability or issues of smallholder concern. However, certification standards are only partially adjusted to the latter. After a 'voluntary industry standards' phase of differentiation with and shifting blame to non-certified others [3], government involvement in Malaysia and Indonesia suggests that standards and certification can trickle down to enforceable good practice standards for all. This can learn from past ineffective policies that did not address the real issues in local context [4]. On the other hand, subnational jurisdictional entities are the scale at which oil palm production can be balanced with other goals, such as forest conservation and smallholder welfare. This needs a supportive and clear national policy support that combines clarity on forest protection (as in the now permanent moratorium), with support for risk-reducing diversified smallholder oil palm production systems [5,6] and international communication that acknowledges past problems but shows Indonesia is ready to move on, connecting all the dots of sustainable development goals.},

	abstract = {Providing smallholder farmers with support through conventional government extension approaches is challenging as the number of extension agents is decreasing. At the same time, new information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as short message services (SMS) sent via mobile phones, show considerable promise to complement existing extension services. In the UP-scaling Technology in Agriculture through Knowledge and Extension (UPTAKE) Project, ICTs were used to create awareness and increase uptake and adoption of agricultural innovations by maize farmers in Tanzania. Two SMS-based maize campaigns were implemented during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 cropping seasons in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Prior to the start of the campaigns, formative research to determine maize production knowledge, practices and challenges was conducted in Mbeya and Songwe Region. After the campaign a telephone survey, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted. During the campaign, about 3.8 million SMS were disseminated to over 55,000 farmers. 73\% were male, 19\% owned smart phones and 86\% farmed maize on up to 1.2 hectares of land. Farmers reported maize production challenges as: unreliable markets, inadequate extension services, pest outbreaks and lack of knowledge to identify counterfeit inputs particularly seeds and fertilizers. The UPTAKE mobile SMS campaign was a new approach to agricultural extension in this area. A telephone survey amongst a sample of farmers who received the SMS revealed that 53\% of respondents considered that this was now their preferred as a source of information compared to traditional sources including neighbours and family members, demonstration plots, agricultural extension workers and radios. Key lessons learnt relate to management of databases of farmer contacts, importance of participatory processes in developing content and designing SMS campaigns, and the need for flexibility and promptness in responding to emerging threats such as delayed rains and outbreaks of pests. Good practices like buy in and authorizations from the government administrative structures and compliance with country’s regulations on communication are integral to the success of ICT projects.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the effects of voluntary cooperativisationas conducted by the Community-Based Dairy Veterinary Foundation (CDVF) on the livelihood capital of smallholder dairy farmers. An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80\%) and high gains (50.20\%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers’ improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envdev.2019.100487},
	abstract = {Large-scale land exploitation to jumpstart backward economies is often accompanied by massive environmental impacts. The broad concepts of productivity-oriented ‘bio-economy’ and conservation-oriented ‘eco-economy’ were proposed to transform exploitative land-based economies. Taking cases in Borneo as core examples, this paper explores 10 transformative strategies for sustainability: boosting upstream productivity of cash crops, activating under-utilised low carbon (ULC) land for production, upgrading and diversifying downstream activities, branding for more values (industrial), establishing new domestic demand for bio-resources, creating values for carbon and ecosystem services, enhancing agro-ecological resilience, establishing eco-based tertiary sectors, branding for more values (smallholders), and encouraging self-sufficient farming. Generally, utility-based development strategies with wealth creation as the centre of policymaking are inadequate to repair the previous environmental damage. Likewise, strategies that prioritise restoration have shown a limited contribution to economic growth as observed in the case of Borneo. The interconnected nature of economic productivity and conservation means that no single strategy is a perfect solution but a combination of them may produce a better outcome. While integrated landscape analysis that combines land-use models and economic analyses can facilitate understanding of the systems, in-depth area studies are necessary to capture the more subtle ‘human factors’ like socio-political dynamics. The existence of multiple stakeholders with different interests and values means that an ‘optimal’ combination would be a result of political negotiations rather than scientific investigations. To design and also effectively execute the strategies, communication, collaboration and co-production of knowledge between scientific communities and various stakeholders is imperative.},

Challenges included an inefficient domestic seed distribution system, technical constraints in seed production and conditioning by seed companies, inadequate networks and communication among the seed industry’s key participants, and partial regulation of the seed industry. Seed companies played a key role in seed conditioning processes. Companies imported all tomato seeds into Uganda and stated germination as their primary goal for quality. Challenges for seed companies included assistance from MAAIF to regulate and certify seed and access to improved technologies.

Even though it is in infant stage, there are many agricultural ICT related service and application in Ethiopia. The current radical penetration of ICTs like mobile phone, website, social media and other internet/online services brings an immense prospect to farmers to create, share, store, process, interpret and preserve agricultural information and knowledge. ICT related agricultural extension system is the solely choice for dissemination of agricultural knowledge and information. Ethiopia is the country which has more than 65000 extension personnel for agricultural extension. But this extension system is not sustainable since it is very costly and inefficient. Thus, agricultural extension policy and intervention should focus on ICT based extension system.},

	abstract = {The overall willingness of smallholder farmers to adopt new green technologies remains low, in spite of the great progress made in understanding the factors that affect their decision. The present study introduces an interdisciplinary approach combining positive psychology and sustainable development studies to show that two personal resources – self-control (a learned repertoire of goal-directed skills that enable people to act upon their aims) and cognitive goal-oriented hope (the ability to follow different routes to pursue one's goal), prompt the adoption of technologies by smallholder farmers. Both personal resources facilitate achieving future goals and changing existing circumstances. A theoretical moderation model on the adoption of agricultural technologies aimed to protect soil degradation in Nepal is proposed and empirically tested. Data were collected from 268 households in the Jhapa district by a face-to-face questionnaire. A multiple regression analysis tested and confirmed the hypothesized moderation model. Following the discovery of a significant interaction, the nature of the interaction was farther explored by calculating simple slopes. Analysis results show a significant positive connection between self-control (p-value = 0.002), hope (p-value = 0.005), information (p-value {\textless} 0.001), and technology adoption. Self-control was also found to have a significant moderating effect in enhancing a positive association between receiving information and technology adoption (p-value = 0.017). In addition to its theoretical innovation and empirical contribution, the importance of this study lies in its practical implications, given that policy, education, and communication may influence hope and self-control levels.},

The independent variables used were farmers’ age, education level, number of dependents, farming experiences and cultivated land area, while dependent variable was farmers’ internet literacy rate. The effect of independent variables to dependent variable were analyzed by regression analysis using SPSS. The results revealed that farmers had a very low rate of internet literacy. There was limited ownership of communication facilities and intensity of internet utilization, while the application of information derived from the internet for farming was very low. Education level was found to have a positive and significant effect on farmers’ internet literacy rate, whereas the age of farmer and farming experiences showed a significantly negative effect. Farmers were lack of ability to select and apply information obtained from the internet independently, hence interpersonal communication with extension agents was still prominent for the farmers.

An efficient endogenous switching regression model (ESRM) was used to estimate the impact of climate change adaptation strategy on the net income of rice farmers. The MVP results show that the socio-economic factors, the institutional factors, and locational variables of some households statistically influenced the choice of climate change adaptation strategies employed. Complementarities among all the adaptation strategies used by the farmers were revealed by the positive pair-wise correlation matrix of the MVP model. The study also indicated that farmers affected by prolonged drought and incidences of flood were more likely to adopt adaptation strategies on their farmlands. The ESRM treatment effect indicated that the average net income per rice farm of those who adopted the strategies was significantly higher than that of those who did not. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations related to agricultural extension systems and climate change education through information and communication technologies.

	abstract = {Developing a conceptual model is vital for small-scale organic farmer's credit access to sustain the livelihoods. However, smallholders continually face severe problems in getting finance that lead to reduce investment and in turn, challenges the livelihoods. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to establish and empirically test a theoretical model to explore how agility and innovativeness in organic food value chain finance are achieved through ITI, TRST, CG, ICT, and IS, and how these, in turn, can accelerate financial flow in the value chain and enhance competitiveness. The present study used a survey method and collected data from small-scale farmers, traders, and financial institutions. The model and hypothesis are tested using data obtained from 331 respondents through partial least square structure equation modeling techniques. We argue that development of theoretical model show potential to increase creditworthiness of smallholders and overcome uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangement. Thus, the present study could provide new ways to integrate the value chain partners, through information and communication technology and governance arrangements in the organic food value chain financing. This study demonstrates that the mediations of innovativeness and agility significantly affect the development of new financial products to make agile the financial flow, which in turn positively influences value chain competitiveness. Significant judgments are required for trustworthy relations among the value chain partners to positively harness innovative product development for swifter value chain finance. Therefore, this theoretical model should not be regarded as a quick solution, but a process of testing, error, and learning by doing so.},

This region, which is known for its monsoon climate (which involves a distinct temporal and spatial variation in rainfall), has experienced a decrease in annual rainfall over the last century. This study is aimed at investigating how smallholder farmers perceive climate change and at identifying the methods that these smallholders use to adapt to climate change. We use data collected from a survey of 215 households to compare the climate vulnerability of three watershed communities in Kerala. We find that the farmers perceive substantial increases in both temperature and the unpredictability of monsoons; this is in accordance with actual observed weather trends. The selection of effective adaptation strategies is one of the key challenges that smallholders face as they seek to reduce their vulnerability. The surveyed households simultaneously use various adaptation methods, including information and communication technology, crop and farm diversification, social networking through cooperatives, and soil and water conservation measures. The results of a binary regression model reveal that the household head's age, education and gender, as well as the farm's size and the household's size, assets, livestock ownership, poverty status and use of extension services, are all significantly correlated with the households' choices regarding adaptations to cope with climate change.},

On the one hand, NGOs advocate balancing ecology and economy, while on the other hand, the Vietnamese government supports intensifying shrimp production. The latter strategy increases shrimp diseases and marginalises smallholders. To influence the opinions, knowledge and behaviour of shrimp farmers, we developed and tested a serious board game. Approach: Through several iterations, we designed a realistic board game mimicking local shrimp farming. Then, after conducting three sessions of gameplay with farmers in three sites, we assessed how this gameplay influenced players. We used a semi-experimental set-up by collecting data on the day of the gameplay, and on two further time-points. Findings: After the gameplays, farmers reported to have learned about the risks of monoculture-intensive-shrimp system and the advantages of hybrid systems. Likert ratings showed that players adopted innovations faster and, in case of shrimp diseases, consulted commercial service-providers less, but with other farmers more. They confirmed to have learned that the best strategy for them would be to adopt hybrid systems, i.e. intensify part of the area of mixed-mangrove or improved-extensive shrimp farms. Theoretical implications: Realistic board games can create opportunities for social learning and training of groups which are not always easy to reach. Practical implications: Board games can support transfer of knowledge and skills to farmers, and can develop their critical thinking. Creation: The findings that board games are effective in the context of a top-down extension systems offer value opportunities.},

	abstract = {Understanding broiler farmers' intention toward highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) control is important to design successful HPAI control programs. We used Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to identify factors (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) associated with the intentions of Western-Java small-scale broiler farmers toward implementing cleaning and disinfection (C\&D), vaccination, reporting, and stamping-out without or with 50\% compensation. For this, 203 Western-Java farmers were interviewed. The majority of the farmers had a positive intention to implement C\&D (89\%), reporting (88\%), and vaccination (80\%). A lower number had a positive intention to join stamping-out both with 50\% compensation (67\%) and without any compensation (53\%). Farmers had a more positive attitude and subjective norm, but lower perceived behavioral control toward one or more of the intentions to implement measures. Attitude was positively associated with intentions to implement C\&D and vaccination. Subjective norm of veterinarians of integrated companies was positively associated with intentions to implement vaccination. Perceived behavioral control (i.e., money and time) was positively associated with intentions to implement C\&D, vaccination, and stamping-out without any compensation. Results suggest that farmers are in favor of implementing preventive measures (i.e., C\&D and vaccination) on HPAI control over facing the consequences of control measures (i.e., stamping-out), and HPAI control programs should primarily focus on incentivizing farmers complemented by programs aiming to improve farmers' attitude. Thus, policy should be emphasized to preventive measures rather than control measures. Financial incentive-based instruments (e.g., price and performance bonus) can be used to increase the intention of farmers to implement C\&D and vaccination. Trained vaccinators might help to save the time needed to vaccinate the entire flock can increase the intention of farmers to vaccinate their chickens. Also, informational instruments (e.g., education and communication) can be used to change and to improve the attitude of farmers to implement both measures.},

	abstract = {Climate change is likely to generate severe impacts on smallholder farmers in developing countries. As key drivers of adaptation, climate risk perceptions are highly heterogeneous, varying both across people and context, and are complex, being defined as behaviour which varies across both impact and likelihood dimensions in non-linear ways. Yet most studies examining risk perceptions are unable to disentangle the role of perceptions regarding impacts from those regarding the likelihood of climate-related events taking place. This paper presents a decomposition and associated analysis of survey-based ‘risk perception’ measures. The decomposition we apply allows independent accounting for perceptions over frequencies and impacts linking to behavioural patterns of risk attitude. The approach presented here draws on a detailed 2017 survey of 500 farmers in rural Indonesia to generate insights into the relationship between risk perceptions and extension services, accessibility of information, and other factors. Results show that risk perceptions are generated from complex interaction between perceived future frequencies and outcomes of climate events and indicate differential impacts of extension services across these perceptions. This paper also presents empirical support for the use of information and communication technology based extension as an efficient extension tool to reach more farmers than in traditional methods.},

Here, a comprehensive participatory pipeline is described that included 56 Nepalese women farmer editors to develop 100 picture-based lessons. Thereafter, the Theory of Planned Behavior is used as a framework to evaluate 20 diverse lessons using quantitative and qualitative data (Nvivo-11) collected from four groups, focusing on low-literacy women: the women farmer editors (n = 56); smallholder field testers who had prior exposure to extension agents and the actual innovations (control group, n = 120), and those who did not (test group, n = 60); expert stakeholders (extension agents/scientists, n = 25). The expected comprehension difference between farmer groups was non-substantive, suggesting that the participatory editing/testing approaches were effective. There were surprising findings compared to the academic literature: smallholders comprehended the pictures without the help of extension agents, perhaps because of the participatory approaches used; children assisted their mothers to understand caption-based lessons; the farmers preferred printed pictures compared to advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs); and the resource-poor farmers were willing to pay for the printed materials, sufficient to make them cost-neutral/scalable. These findings have implications for smallholder farmers beyond Nepal.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in Nepal are vulnerable to climate change-related extreme weather events. Adaptation in the agriculture sector is needed to mitigate social, economic, and ecological impacts from increasing levels of hazard activity. To examine this issue, a household survey of 350 farmers in the Terai region of Nepal was carried out to assess farmers’ risk perceptions towards three common extreme weather events (floods, cold spells, and heat waves) and to explore their intended responses to cope with future impacts. The intended common adaptation strategies include changes in farm management, seeking off-farm employment, emergency management planning, purchasing crop insurance, and the raising of awareness. Threat appraisal is the strongest predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted in response to slow-onset hazards (heat waves and cold spells), while coping appraisal is the major predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted to mitigate flood risk, a rapid onset hazard. Crop insurance and off-farm employment are farmers’ most preferred flood adaptation strategies, while crop insurance is the most preferred adaptation strategy for heat waves and cold spells. Other variables such as the number of past implemented strategies, experience with extreme events, community organisation membership, and access to credit and extension services were also significantly associated with farmers’ choices for adaptation strategies in response to the three extreme events. This information can be used to tailor community-centred communication about potential threats from different extreme weather events and government technical and financial support, which will be crucial for farmers to adapt effectively to climate change-related weather extremes.},

	abstract = {To construct more sustainable ways of using coastal resources, collaboration between society, decision makers, and scientists is highly advocated. Some social sectors consider that scientists do not adequately participate in the problems of society, and that although scientific knowledge continues to grow, socioecological problems are worsening. The generation of scientific knowledge, as well as its dissemination to address societal problems, should go beyond what traditionally has been done. The exchange of information among stakeholders is essential in the management of socioecological systems and the importance of understanding these flows is increasingly recognized. We investigated the role that scientific research has played in small-scale fisheries on the southern coast of Jalisco, Mexico. We used Social Network Analysis to visualize and understand the information flow between three sectors: fishers, academia, and government. Our findings suggest that the geographical distance between the actors plays an important role and defines many of the interactions between the sectors. In addition, distrust, language differences, lack of cooperation and leadership within the fishing organizations, and a lack of empathy between the actors, are all obstacles that actors face when discussing actions plans. The governmental sector has the ability to collect and disseminate information, yet it has not done enough to share the information in an effective way. While academia is a reliable and constant source of information, it has a peripheral role in the social network and there is a lack of communication strategies in place to enable the data generated to be utilized effectively. This study may provide an alternative pathway for research institutions to understand their role when examining issues in the regions where they work.},

Our study used a semi-qualitative approach, called Q methodology, to identify patterns of opinion on antimicrobial use, or its alternatives, among pig and poultry smallholders and drug vendors in the commune of Imerintsiatosika, in Madagascar. Twenty-nine breeders and 23 drug vendors were asked to rank, respectively, 38 and 45 statements, produced from semi-structured interviews and secondary data, through a 7 grade scale from −3 (totally disagree) to +3 (totally agree) about antimicrobial use, related risks and alternatives. The interview ended with a discussion around extreme statements. The Q-sortings were analyzed by factor analysis and Principal Component Analysis. Regarding antimicrobial use, antimicrobial resistance and alternatives, the breeders and drug vendors were divided according to three discourses: “A: confidence in antibiotics” (respectively, 13 and 6 individuals), “B: belief in alternatives” (7 and 7 individuals), and “C: moderate approach to antibiotic use” (6 and 6 individuals), explaining, respectively, 57 and 60\% of total variance. Group A was associated with the use of antibiotics as a preventive measure, poor knowledge of resistance and low trust in alternatives. Group B considered the preventive use of antibiotics to be a major problem for antimicrobial resistance and believed that alternatives, such as vaccines, were useful preventive methods. Group C seemed to have a hazy opinion. The presence of three main points of view offers the possibility to adapt awareness messages. Group B might also be used as a showcase to reduce the amounts of antibiotics used by the two other groups. This study revealed different practices and risk perceptions related to antimicrobial use that must be better characterized and accurately quantified.},

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been advanced as a promising way to overcome many of the problems associated with conventional agricultural extension. We evaluate the effectiveness of an ICT-mediated approach to deliver agricultural information in a field experiment conducted among small-scale maize farmers in eastern Uganda. Three complementary technologies designed to address both informational and behavioral constraints to technical change are considered. First, we investigate the effectiveness of audiovisual messages (video) as a means of delivering information on input use and improved maize management practices to farmers. Second, we quantify the additional impact of complementing video with an interactive voice response (IVR) service. Third, we estimate the incremental effect of time-sensitive short message services (SMS) messages designed to remind farmers about applying key practices at specific points during the season. We find that households that were shown a short video on how to become better maize farmers were performing significantly better on a knowledge test, more likely to apply recommended practices, and more likely to use fertilizer than households that did not view the video. These same households also reported maize yields about 10.5\% higher than those that did not view the video. We find little evidence of an incremental effect of the IVR service or SMS reminders.},

	abstract = {Climatic change has a negative impact on people's livelihoods, agriculture, freshwater supply and other natural resources that are important for human survival. Therefore, understanding how rural smallholder farmers perceive climate change, climate variability, and factors that influence their choices would facilitate a better understanding of how these farmers adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. A Zero-inflated double hurdle model was employed to estimate the factors influencing farmers’ adoption of adaptation strategies and intensity of adoption at the household level in South Africa. Different socioeconomic factors such as gender, age, and experience in crop farming, institutional factors like access to extension services, and access to climate change information significantly influenced the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among beneficiaries of land reform in South Africa. Concerning intensity of adoption, age, educational level, farming experience, on-farm training, off-farm income, access to information through ICT and locational variables are the significant determinants of intensity of adaptation strategies. Thus, education attainment, non-farm employment, farming experience are significant incentives to enhance smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity through the adoption of many adaptation approaches. This study therefore concluded that farm-level policy efforts that aim to improve rural development should focus on farmers’ education, on-farm demonstration and non-farm employment opportunities that seek to engage the farmers, particularly during the off-cropping season. The income from non-farm employment can be plough-back into farm operations such as the adoption of soil and water conservation, use of improved planting varieties, insurance, among others to mitigate climate variability and subsequently increase productivity. Policies and investment strategies of the government should be geared towards supporting education, providing on-farm demonstration trainings, and disseminating information about climate change adaptation strategies, particularly for smallholder farmers in the country. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations around the agricultural extension system and education on climate change using information and communication technologies.},

Middlemen have good knowledge of working conditions of markets and have access to agricultural market information. Due to poor access to markets and agricultural market information by smallholders, there is a feeling that middlemen benefit more while farmers sell their crops. Good access to markets and market information may help farmers bypass middlemen while selling crops and thus benefit more. Thus, it is best to improve the informational capabilities (ICs) of farmers in agricultural marketing. Thus, this research measured ICs of farmers accessing market information, through a program NINAYO, while selling their crops. The research utilized the informational, psychological, social, and economic dimensions of the empowerment framework in identifying capability indicators to formulate survey questions. Data were collected from smallholders in six regions in Tanzania. The analysis utilized measures of life satisfaction and results showed that about half of the variation in the dependent variable, satisfaction with capabilities, was explained by the model. Backward elimination analysis confirmed that life satisfaction is multidimensional. Robustness test confirmed a positive relationship between satisfaction and capabilities.

	abstract = {This paper explores key elements of an extension approach for enhancing the sustainability and realizing the scaling-up of tree growing by smallholder farmers in rural remote areas where extension services seldom reach and access to external markets is difficult. By referring to the case in Madagascar, the paper discusses that creating a certain number of local trainers is effective because they function as a driver to promote tree growing and new livelihood activities introduced by external agents using locally available resources. One critical issue of being a local trainer is to have good communication skills in relation to fellow farmers. This issue can be addressed by sharing the importance of communication skills of local trainers in a community so that fellow farmers can facilitate local trainers’ reflection unless a farmer does not feel reliable to a local trainer. On a mid- to longer-term basis, income opportunities will become an important point of motivation for local trainers. Creating new livelihood activities that can generate income and simultaneously contribute to village development is the way to go. This will enable local trainers to maintain their motivation and thus lead to sustainable tree growing activities.},

Analysing interviews from farmers in a rural Nigerian agrarian community based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA), the findings reveal that the ease of communications, social interactions, improved farm skills and knowledge afforded by mobile phone use leads to improved opportunities for farmers. These opportunities resonate in the entire farming value chain thereby enhancing farmers’ livelihoods. However, some human capital deficiencies and contextual factors bordering on language barrier, lack of capability and awareness in the use of mobile phone features and functionalities inhibit farmers from benefiting optimally from the leverages provided by mobile phones.

To reflect different aspects of climate exposure, we include both self-reported climate shocks and spatially interpolated weather data. The assessment of 1127 households shows that while both districts have similar exposure and adaptive capacity levels, the sensitivity dimension makes Vaishali more vulnerable to climate change. To reduce sensitivity, decision-makers should focus on improving infrastructure (e.g., permanent housing, latrines, health centers, alternative energy sources). To improve adaptive capacity and reduce climate risk in both regions, policymakers should promote the expansion of extension training for livelihood diversification, information and communication technologies as well as conservation agriculture.},

The results show that the GCTs adoption behaviors of adjacent family farmers are spatially correlated and strongest when they are within 2.0 km of each other. Farm leaders’ educational level, degree of risk preference, financial status, number of laborers, understanding of GCTs and of the dangers of chemical pesticides, knowledge of other GCT adopters, frequency of communication with neighbors, participation in technical training and the strength of media publicity have significantly positive effects on the GCT adoption behaviors of family farms, which are mainly influenced by the direct effects of characteristic variables. However, the spatial spillover effects of neighboring family farmers’ participation in technical training, number of laborers, and financial status cannot be ignored.

	abstract = {The importance of extension services in helping smallholder farmers to address the many challenges of agricultural production cannot be over-emphasized. However, relatively few studies have been conducted that investigate how the capacities of agricultural extension agents can be built to more effectively assist smallholder farmers in managing climate risks and impacts. As climate change is a key threat to smallholder food production, addressing this issue is increasingly important. This paper aims to identify how agricultural extension agents in Ghana can better support smallholder farmers in navigating and addressing the effects of climate change on food production. It asks: (i) what are the sources of information used by agricultural extension agents in Ghana's Upper East region? (ii) what are the capacity building needs of agricultural extension agents for effective communication of climate information for building resilient agricultural systems? (iii) what are the key barriers to successful extension outcomes for climate change adaptation? The paper uses a mixed methods approach including three regional stakeholder workshops, expert interviews and surveys with 32 agricultural extension agents in northeastern Ghana. Results addressing question (i) indicated that radios and television are the dominant sources of climate information for agricultural extension agents in the Upper East region. Findings targeting question (ii) identified capacity building needs such as developing extension agents’ technical skills, improving communication skills, improving knowledge and use of climate smart agricultural interventions such as soil moisture conservation methods, and training on information communication technologies (ICT) to deliver extension advice on climate change. Other needs included developing skills in field demonstration and project monitoring and evaluation. Addressing question (iii), key barriers confronted by agricultural extension agents in the delivery of extension on climate change included lack of transportation facilities for extension agents, lack of appropriate extension materials, high agricultural extension agent to farmer ratios, and inadequate funds to implement adaptation practices. Wider barriers reducing the effectiveness of extension efforts included farmer resistance to change and complex land tenure arrangements that do not allow investment. Periodic workshops should be organised for agricultural extension agents on the use of ICT to deliver extension services, whilst encouraging the use of audio-visuals in extension delivery. These efforts should be supported by regular assessments of extension agents’ capacity building needs.},

This paper analyzes the factors influencing the probability and intensity of adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices in Ghana, and identify the possible combinations of ISFM practices used by farmers based on their perceptions of climate variability and shocks. The empirical results revealed that demographic, farm-related variables, land quality, institutional factors, relative isolation, and recent experience of climate variability and shocks influence the probability and intensity of ISFM adoption. Perceptions of climate variability and shocks have a heterogeneous effect on the adoption of multiple ISFM practices. Farmers exposed to precipitation shocks are more likely to complement mulch with residue as an adaptive response to evapotranspiration while substitute mulch with mineral fertilizer. The results highlight the risk-averse decisions and mitigation strategies employed by farmers. Providing adequate and timely climate information to farmers will mitigate the biases related to the perception of climate variability and subsequently improve soil fertility choice. Strengthening the farmer-research-extension linkages coupled with communication of “better fit” ISFM practices will increase adoption.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim: Classical swine fever (CSF) is one of the primary diseases in animals in Indonesia, particularly areas that supply pig meat to the country, such as Karanganyar district, Central Java. The government has tried to prevent and control the disease by vaccination, but it has not yet given effective results. Therefore, another attempt to prevent the recurrence of CSF cases is to apply biosecurity in pig farms by looking for risk factors associated with on-farm and off-farm contact. This study aims to determine the contact rate and investigate the risk factors associated with on-farm and off-farm contact in commercial and smallholder pig farms in Karanganyar, Central Java, Indonesia, in the context of controlling CSF disease. Materials and Methods: This study used a cross-sectional study design in which the pig farm was designed as the observed epidemiological unit. The contact structure data were conducted by sampling using a two-stage random method. We selected Karanganyar district because it is the center of a pig farm in the Central Java Province and has many CSF cases in several years before. The study was conducted for more or less 1 month from August to September 2019. The contact data were collected from 37 smallholder farms and 27 commercial farms within interviews. Risk factors for contact with pigs were analyzed using logistic regression using theStatistix Program version 8.0 (www.statistix.com). Results: In comparison to smallholder farms, commercial farms had 2.38 and 3.32 times higher contact rate in outside farms and inside farms, respectively. Two factors increased the risk for on-farm contacts including commercials type farm (p=0.0012; odds ratio [OR]=8.32) with contact rate of 1.24 times/day and the time interval of CSF vaccination for 1-3 months (p=0.0013; OR=8.43) with contact rate of 0.98 times/day, and three factors increased the risk for off-farm contacts including the commercial farm type (p=0.012; OR=4.88) with 1.50 contact/day, the time interval of CSF vaccination for 1-3 months (p=0.036; OR=3.83) with 1.30 contact/day, and farmers with experience in pig husbandry {\textless}5 years (p=0.075; OR=3.56) with 1.13 contact/day. Conclusion: This study shows that commercial farms and short CSF vaccination intervals increased the risk of either off-farm or on-farm contacts. The contact structure of pig farms in Karanganyar district is similar to that in other areas in Indonesia. Reducing the risk of contacts either outside or inside the pig farms is essential to prevent disease transmission. Enhancing communication and education to pig farmers and surveillance is also necessary to prevent such diseases in pigs.},

The main feedback loops show that the greatest bane to farming in the area is insecurity and climate variability. However, better access to information and communications afforded by mobile phones empowers farmers and enables them to overcome these vulnerabilities. The use of feedback loops in analysis provides rigour and depth to the findings due to their ability to demonstrate the interdependencies between system components.

Both groups received a US\$ 100 voucher each growing season and the co-learning group also took part in co-learning activities. The integrated co-learning approach was comprised of four complementary elements: input vouchers, an iterative learning process, common grounds for communication, and complementary knowledge. Central to the approach were co-learning workshops before each season. Workshop topics built on topics from previous seasons and on farmers' feedback and researchers' observations. Activities during each season included farm management monitoring, yield measurements and evaluation interviews. This resulted in multiple learning loops for both farmers and researchers. The voucher fostered learning through increased and diversified input use. For instance, intercropped legumes were smothered by the prolific growth of maize resulting from increased fertilizer use. After setting up joint demonstrations, farmers started to use alternative spacing options for intercropping. Building common ground on concepts and processes governing farm system functioning fostered a deeper understanding by farmers on the suitability of options to their farm and by researchers on locally relevant content. Soil fertility gradients was such a concept through which judicious use of fertilizers was discussed. After five seasons, co-learning farmers had a more diverse and cohesive knowledge of their farm than comparison farmers. Co-learning farmers highlighted farm level management options, management of the parasitic weed striga and options for integrated soil fertility management as the most important things they learned. A tangible learning outcome was the continued increase in groundnut and soybean area among co-learning farmers, which led to more diversified maize cropping systems. We attribute these differences to the co-learning process. Our results demonstrate how the integrated co-learning approach changed both knowledge and practices of participating farmers and researchers. The amplifying effects of the four key elements appeared to be important for enabling sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11250-020-02550-w},
	abstract = {Newcastle disease (ND) poses a challenge especially for farmers rearing indigenous chicken under the extensive system. This is due to the lack of uniformity in practices, favoring the introduction and spread of the disease. This is worsened by the lack of information on how management practices contribute to the spread of ND. The current study assessed the role of extensive chicken production systems and management practices on the frequency of ND outbreaks in Kenya using a Poisson regression model (PRM) on primary survey data from 332 farmers in Kakamega and Machakos counties. Descriptive results showed a low access to institutional support services like extension, training, credit, and vaccination services for both male and female farmers. Results from the PRM analysis show that flock size, isolated and confined housing, multi-aged flock mixture, screening of birds, access to ND vaccination, ND awareness, distance to agro-veterinary service providers, and access to animal health training and extension services had significant effects on the frequency of ND outbreaks. The findings underscore the need for innovative extension approaches that facilitate the use of information communication technologies to create more awareness on disease detection and mitigation measures. Use of farmer groups as innovation platforms for enhanced skill sharing and as key peer monitoring channels would also improve compliance with prescribed disease control methods. Further, there is a need for partnerships between local-level county governments, vaccine producers, and agro-veterinary service providers to ensure the development of low-cost vaccines and requisite storage facilities, and their timely delivery to the male and female resource-poor smallholder extensive chicken farmers.},

	volume = {10},
	doi = {10.1186/s40066-020-00277-3},
	abstract = {Background: Agriculture contributes significantly to the welfare of smallholder farmers, but it has become highly susceptible to climate change, due to its reliance on the increasingly erratic rainfall patterns. Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) offers important opportunities for enhancing food security and incomes through increased agriculture productivity. Technology evaluation through impact studies provides information on the effect of CSA on farmer welfare, thereby highlighting its potential in optimizing agriculture productivity. This paper analyses the impact of CSA adoption on food security and income of households, using cross-sectional survey data collected from 386 households across four districts in Zimbabwe. The analysis was done using the endogenous switching regression model which controls for selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity, a commonly used method in adoption impact analysis. Results: The study found several agricultural and socio-economic factors which affect adoption and food security. The econometric results show that the status of soil fertility in fields, distance to input and output markets, ownership of communication assets, and Total Livestock Units (TLU) have a significant impact on the decision of farmers to adopt CSA. The Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATT) and Average Treatment Effects on the Untreated (ATU) were found to be positive and significant for adopters and non-adopters, indicating that CSA adoption has had a significantly positive impact on the welfare of the farmers. An analysis of the outcomes revealed that the characteristics of farmers and farms, as well as market factors, significantly affect the welfare of households. The household income, with reference to the adoption of CSA, was significantly affected by factors such as the education of household head, labour size, TLU, and asset index. Food security was influenced by factors such as the education of household head, TLU, access to sanitation, and arable land size. Conclusions: The study concludes by giving policy recommendations centred on the access to inputs, sanitation, and encouraging investing in assets and TLU. The findings indicate that the adoption of CSA has a positive impact on the welfare of farmers. To exploit the full potential of these technologies, the study suggests that access to timely weather forecasts must be ensured, that sanitation must be promoted, and that incentives must be provided for agricultural input agro-dealers to decentralize to rural areas.},

	abstract = {Smallholder farmers in Ethiopia are vulnerable to climate change impacts due to their low adaptive capacity and dependence on rainfed agriculture. Thus, a successful weather forecast system may bring significant economic and social value to the community. The main objectives of this study were to identify the key information exchange agents, understand the information flow path, rank the relative importance of the different information dissemination pathways, and determine weather forecast adoption. We conducted a household survey in five villages of Rim Kebele in Bahir Dar area and found that farmers communicate with four main agents with regard to information exchange. We developed an agent-based model to learn the adoption rates of weather forecast information. Agriculture extension agents were found to be the most influential members of the community. Farmers’ communicating with neighboring village farmers showed higher adoption. Our results show at least twice that improvements in communication network attain higher adoption rates. Radio has also demonstrated positive uptake of information. We also found that forecast accuracy of 70\% is sufficient to achieve high adoption rates. Our findings might help decision-makers recognize critical information flow pathways and their relative importance, and identify barriers to disseminating weather forecast information in the community.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11625-021-00936-9},
	abstract = {Despite concerted efforts, achieving the goal of universal food security remains challenging. Food security interventions occur at different levels of systemic depth. Some interventions target visible supply-side gaps, while others focus on deeper systemic problems in the food system. Here, we used a leverage points perspective to ask how multiple types of more superficial (shallow) and more fundamental (deep) interventions in the food system interact. Focusing on a case study in southwestern Ethiopia, we examined (1) recent changes in formal and informal institutions related to food security; (2) the effects of formal and informal institutions on the food system at different levels of systemic depth (i.e., on parameters, feedbacks, design, and intent); and (3) issues of institutional interplay between formal and informal institutions. We surveyed 150 rural households and analyzed key policy documents. Both formal and informal institutions were perceived to improve food security. However, at the intent level, formal institutions primarily aimed to enhance food supply, while informal institutions additionally sought to build trust among farmers. At the design level, formal interventions targeted information flow through a newly created agricultural extension system, while informal institutions facilitated labor sharing and communication. In terms of institutional interplay, new formal institutions had partly undermined pre-existing informal institutions. We conclude that both visible supply-side gaps and deeper drivers of food insecurity should be targeted through food security interventions. Interventions need to be cognizant of potentially unexpected ways of institutional interplay, especially between formal and informal institutions.},

	abstract = {Driven by the rapid adoption of Internet-based technologies amongst producers in the Global South, the question of how and whether global value chain arrangements are reconfigured remains open to debate. This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production.},

	abstract = {The creation of commercialization opportunities for smallholder farmers has taken primacy on the development agenda of many developing countries. Invariably, most of the smallholders are less productive than commercial farmers and continue to lag in commercialization. Apart from the various multifaceted challenges which smallholder farmers face, limited access to extension services stands as the underlying constraint to their sustainability. Across Africa and Asia, public extension is envisioned as a fundamental part of the process of transforming smallholder farmers because it is their major source of agricultural information. Extension continues to be deployed using different approaches which are evolving. For many decades, various authors have reported the importance of the approaches that effectively revitalize extension systems and have attempted to fit them into various typologies. However, there is a widespread concern over the inefficiency of these extension approaches in driving the sustainability of smallholder farming agenda. Further, most of the approaches that attempted to revolutionize extension have been developed and brought into the field in rapid succession, but with little or no impact at the farmer level. This paper explores the theory and application of agricultural extension approaches and argues the potential of transforming them using digital technologies. The adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as mobile phones and the internet which are envisaged to revolutionize existing extension systems and contribute towards the sustainability of smallholder farming systems is recommended.},

However, few empirical studies have considered how smallholders utilise ICT in Central Vietnam. This research investigates the Central Vietnamese smallholders’ views on the extent of use of ICT for accessing agricultural information. A sample size of 250 smallholders was randomly selected from a total of 687 smallholders in Trieu Phong district, Central Vietnam. A two-section questionnaire was used to gather data. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. The smallholders used mobile phones, TV and radio networks/broadcasts as the common ICT tools, and these were also effective ICT tools for accessing agricultural information. Lack of knowledge and skills for using applications on mobile phones were the main challenge to the smallholders’ use of ICT. A statistically significant relationship, existing between the extent of mobile phone use and the smallholders’ age (χ = 10.04, p = 0.040), gender (χ = 5.99, p = 0.014) and the type of households (χ = 6.84, p = 0.033), was found.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127373},
	abstract = {Climate change such as extreme weather, unexpected temperature and rainfall fluctuations cause several significant risks to the agro-economy. This study, therefore, assessed the determinants of climate change perception (CCP), the level of perception and its impact on net farm income of rice farmers. This is imperative as the actual CC communication and policy, therefore, require a good understanding of smallholders' views and acknowledgment of individual's perception about CC. Employing cross-sectional data from 360 rice farmers selected from three States in South-West, Nigeria, a Ricardian model was used to analyse climate change impact on rice production. While accounting for selection bias, the study employed a double-hurdle (DH) model to estimate the determinants of farmers' perception of climate change. The results of DH estimation model show that location, access to credit, educational level and household size of the farmers are statistically significant factors influencing climate change perception (CCP). The result from the second hurdle shows that the perceived intensity of climate change was influenced by farm size, farming experience, marital status and educational level of smallholder rice farmers. The Ricardian model's result shows that farmers' income is influenced by CCP and their socio-economic characteristics. The results further indicate that smallholder rice farmers' net farm income is sensitive to marginal changes in both temperature and precipitation. Thus, this study recommends that government policies and investment strategies should be geared towards the support of education and the improvement of farmers' cooperatives, credit facilities and information about climate change, particularly in respect of smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The recommended improvements are imperative for food security. Investment in farmer training programmes is essential for development and may also be a panacea for improving the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies with the overall goal of increasing productivity.},
